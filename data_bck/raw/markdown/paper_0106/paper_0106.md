## ABSTRACT

Background: Pyrethroids  have  prominently  known  for  their  insecticidal actions worldwide, but recent reports as anticancer and antiviral applications gained a lot of interest to further understand their safety and immunotoxicity. Objective: This encouraged us to carry out our present study to evaluate the  interactions  of  pyrethroids  toward  adaptive  immune  cell  receptors. Materials and Methods: Type 1 and Type 2 pyrethroids were tested on T  (CD4  and  CD8)  and  B  (CD28  and  CD45)  immune  cell  receptors  using Maestro 9.3 (Schrödinger, LLC, Cambridge, USA). In addition, top-ranked tested  ligands  were  too  explored  for  toxicity  prediction  in  rodents  using ProTOX tool. Results: Pyrethroids (specifically type 2) such as fenvalerate (-5.534  kcal/mol:  CD8),  fluvalinate  (-4.644  and  -  4.431  kcal/mol:  CD4 and  CD45),  and  cypermethrin  (-3.535  kcal/mol:  CD28)  have  outcome  in less energy or more affinity for B-cell and T -cell immune receptors which may later result in the immunosuppressive and hypersensitivity reactions. Conclusion: The  current  findings  have  uncovered  that  there  is  a  further need to assess the Type 2 pyrethroids with wet laboratory experiments to understand the chemical nature of pyrethroid-induced immunotoxicity.

- In addition, cypermethrin outcame in top glide score against CD28 immune receptor
- Top  dock  hits  (Type  2)  pyrethroids  have  shown  probable  toxicity  targets toward AOFA: Amine oxidase (flavin-containing) A and PGH1: Prostaglandin G/H synthase 1, respectively.

## INTRODUCTION

During  the  past decades, pesticides have  recognized  as a  major environmental  chemical  pollution  in  agriculture  which  eventually  resulting in serious health concern. [1-3] Pyrethroid class of pesticides (insecticides) is  often  in  use  due  to  their  low  tendency  to  accumulate  in  organisms and short biodegradation period. [4] Type 1 and Type 2 pyrethroids are basically  synthetic  analogs  derived  from  main  nucleus  pyrethrins,  an imperative  phytochemical  entity  isolated  from  the  flowering  part  of Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium .  The division of pyrethroids into two classes is based on chemical structural differences and toxicological and neurophysiological actions. The chemical difference showed that Type 2 pyrethroids  contain  an α -cyano-phenoxy-benzyl moiety while Type 1 pyrethroids devoid of an α -cyano component which in turns relates to the types of poisoning syndrome. Mostly, synthetic pyrethroids exist in different forms of enantiomers due to their chiral nature. [5-7] The Type 1 compounds  symptoms  include  increased  reactivity  to  whole-body

tremor,  whereas  salivation,  choreoathetosis,  and  chronic  seizures  are quite  common  with  Type  2  pyrethroids. [8,9] The  pyrethroids  are  toxic to insects due to their depolarization action on nerve membranes. [10-12] Photostability, high efficacy at low concentrations, easy disintegration, and low toxicity to birds and mammals are the key rewards of pyrethroid insecticides. [13,14] The  products  containing  pyrethroid  insecticides  are

used for the control of pests such as mites, ants, weevils, and beetles on various crops, including cotton, corn, cereals, soybeans, and vegetables and  also  for  the  control  of  endo-  and  ecto-parasites  on  animals. [15] Pyrethroid insecticides are a product of choice in many countries due to  their  expeditious  metabolism  rate  and  low  toxicity  to  humans  and other nontarget animals. Due to their high potency on a huge number of pests, these have become a premier choice for the control of malaria and other vector-borne diseases. [16-18] For  the  last  two  decades,  diminution on the sales of organophosphorus insecticides researchers has developed pyrethroids with the merits of more  promising insecticidal and antiparasitic formulation. [19,20] Globally, use of pyrethroids has resulted in contamination problem, and moreover, even their metabolites possess a significant role in polluting food and water which ultimately leads to health problems. [17,21] Humans have exposed to pyrethroid insecticides by their well-built use in personal protection such as mosquito nets drenched with pyrethroid insecticides, disinfection of aircraft, in agriculture and public health, respectively. [22-24] Numerous manifestations have observed in the nervous, respiratory, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal systems which ultimately resulting in allergic reactions, myocardial impairment, and even death due to respiratory failure by the minute subjection of pyrethroids  to  the  human  beings. [25] Immunotoxicity  of  pyrethroid insecticides is still unclear specifically on the adaptive immune system. T- and B-cells play the vital role to provide adaptive immunity against pathogens by producing various cytokines and antibodies. CD4 and CD8 are the surface markers which are present on T-cell receptors whereas CD28 and CD45 are present on B-cell receptors. As the immunotoxicity of  pyrethroid  insecticides  on  an  adaptive  immune  system  is  still unexplored, it is essential to first observe their binding affinity towards the adaptive immune cell receptors. Chiral transformation of pyrethroid compounds  may  have  a  different  potential  toward  adaptive  immune system receptors. Molecular docking has provided an important tool for estimating the interaction of compounds toward specific receptors along with its pharmacokinetic properties. Outstandingly, ProTOX online tool has too shown promising toxicity prediction output in the form of LD 50 value against rodents. [26,27] Thus, the main aim of this study is to predict the binding affinity of pyrethroid insecticides toward T-cell (CD4, CD8) and B-cell receptors (CD28, CD45).

## MATERIALS AND METHODS

Docking simulations were run on core TM processor with 4 GB RAM and  220  GB  with  center  Linux  Enterprise  version  as  the  operating system using Maestro 9.3 (Schrödinger, LLC, Cambridge, USA) while toxicity  prediction  was  carried  out  online  through  the  ProTOX  tool. The chemical structures of tested pyrethroids (Type 1 and Type 2) were retrieved from PubChem database.

## Protein preparation

The  immune  proteins  crystal  structures  (1BQH-2.8  Å;  1GC1-2.5  Å; 1YGR-2.9  Å;  1YGR-2.7  Å)  were  obtained  from  RCSB  Protein  Bank. The  crystal  structure  of  CD8  (PDB:  1BQH)  and  CD4  (PDB:  1GC1) glycoprotein was reported to complex with NAG and NDG; NAG, NDG, and α -L-fucose, respectively. Another immune receptors such as CD45 and CD28 (PDB: 1YGR and 1YJD) were found in complex with MET, TYR, and NAG, respectively. Protein preprocess and ionization steps were executed to receptors molecule, a crucial step to the correct geometry of receptors.

## Ligand library

The tested compounds preparations highlighting energy minima were completed  using  least  square  OPLS\_2005  force  field.  The  conformers were too generated and filtered to their energy minima with probable state creation at pH 7 ± 2.0.

## Grid generation and docking calculation

The sitemap option was employed (immune proteins) to generate the possible binding site for hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and H-bond donor/ acceptor  regions.  Extra  precision  (XP)  Glide  docking  was  employed and  finally  docking  pose  examined  through  XP  Visualizer,  indicating possible interactions of the tested entities with the diverse residues of immune receptors.

## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The  ranking  of  screened  pyrethroid  derivatives  was  evaluated  by  the binding energy of the ligands. Table 1 reveals that fenvalerate (-5.534 kcal/ mol)  possess  a  higher  binding  affinity  with  CD8  (1BQH)  immune receptor while Tables 2 and 3 show a higher binding affinity for fluvalinate (-4.644 kcal/mol and -4.431 kcal/mol) against CD4 (1GC1) and CD45 (1YGR)  immune  receptor,  correspondingly.  Moreover,  cypermethrin (-3.535  kcal/mol)  showed  greater  glide  score  toward  CD28  (1YJD) immune protein [Table 4]. The estimated free energy of binding should not be used as an only criterion for the selection of top hits but visual

Overall, fluvalinate resulted in the top most capable hit with a CD4 immune receptor. This compound has revealed promising hydrogen bonding  of  CN  and  NH  groups  with  Thr236  while  oxygen  (other phenyl ring linked) moiety against Phe277. The hydrophobic interactions  were  also  examined  (Val275,  Trp96,  Phe233,  Cys239, Pro238, and Phe277).

## Flumethrin

The compound was capable of wide-ranging hydrophobic bonding with Ile232, Phe353, Val271, Pro238, Phe233, Phe277, Cys239, Val275, and Trp96. Conspicuously, one hydrogen bond of CN group with Lys348 and π -π stacking with Phe277 was also analyzed.

## Fenvalerate

Fenvalerate  was  capable  of  H-bonding  interaction  of  CN  group  with Lys736 residue. In addition, Val832, Ala830, Leu869, Tyr658, and Ile661 residues were also occupied in hydrophobic interactions.

## CD28 (PDB: 1YJD) immune receptor Cypermethrin

This apex hit compound has revealed two hydrogen bonding interactions with Gln59 (C=O group) and Asn53 (oxygen-phenyl linked).

## Permethrin

The  different  amino  acid  residues  such  as  Tyr61,  Tyr51,  Tyr54,  and Tyr100 had resulted in hydrophobic interactions while C=O group and oxygen  (phenyl  ring  linked)  were  too  involved  in  hydrogen  bonding interactions with Gln59 and Asn53, respectively. Conspicuously, a π -π interaction with Tyr54 was too seen.

## Flucythrinate

This compound was an outcome in good hydrogen bonding interactions of C=O group and oxygen (phenyl ring linked) with Asn53 and Gln56, consequently. Moreover, flucythrinate showed hydrophobic interactions with  different  receptor  residues  such  as  Tyr51,  Tyr54,  and  Tyr100 [Figures 1-4].

## Consequences of the interaction of pyrethroid insecticides toward immune cell receptor

Remarkably, due to high sensitivity, the immune system is most easily concern with the toxicity of pyrethroids. Previous studies have shown that any alteration in the immune system serves as a vital predecessor for making an individual immunocompromised and more susceptible to serious health hazards. [29] The current findings have revealed that Type 2 pyrethroids exposed good interactions with immune cell proteins which may be linked to different pathways such as no alteration, autoimmune diseases,  declined  in  the  immune  response,  and  development  of hypersensitivity reactions [Figure 5].

## CONCLUSION

Type  2  pyrethroids  such  as  fenvalerate  (1BQH),  fluvalinate  (1GC1 and 1YGR), and cypermethrin (1YJD) have outcome in apex-graded immunotoxicity  ligands.  Interestingly,  toxicity  of  top-ranked  docked pyrethroids  has  also  been  analyzed  with  LD 50 value  plus  possible toxic  targets.  Although  pyrethroids  have  become  popular  due  to their promising applications in different fields, current in-silico immunotoxic assessments of type 2 pyrethroids have put a big question mark pertaining to human health issues. This tool may further quite helpful for future researchers to validate the results with wet laboratory experiments.
