## Abstract

The rainbow trout gill cell line (RTgill-W1), via test guideline 249 of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, has  been  established  as  a  promising  New  Approach  Methodology,  although  to  advance  confidence  in  the  method  more  case studies  are  needed  that:  1)  expand  our  understanding  of  applicability  domains  (chemicals  with  diverse  properties);  2)  increase methodological throughput (96-well format); and 3) demonstrate biological relevance (in vitro to in vivo comparisons; gill vs. other cells). Accordingly, the objective of our study was to characterize the cytotoxicity of 19 pesticides against RTgill-W1 cells, and also liver  (RTL-W1)  and  gut  epithelial  (RTgutGC)  cell  lines,  and  then  to  compare  the  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  data.  Of  the  19  pesticides tested, 11, 9, and 8 were cytotoxic to the RTgill-W1, RTL-W1, and RTgutGC cells, respectively. Six pesticides (carbaryl, chlorothalonil, chlorpyrifos,  dimethenamid-P,  metolachlor,  and  S-metolachlor)  were  cytotoxic  to  all  three  cell  lines.  Aminomethylphosphonic acid, chlorantraniliprole, dicamba,  diquat,  imazethapyr,  and  permethrin  exhibited  cell-line-specific  toxicity.  No  cytotoxic responses were observed for three herbicides (atrazine, glyphosate, and metribuzin) and four insecticides (clothianidin, diazinon, imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam). When cytotoxicity was measured, there was a strong correlation ( r s ¼ 0.9, p &lt; 0.0001)  between in  vitro  median  effect  concentration  (EC50)  values  (based  on  predicted  concentrations  using  the  In  Vitro  Mass  Balance  Model Equilibrium Partitioning (IV-MBM EQP) Ver. 2.1) derived from RTgill-W1 and RTL-W1 cells with in vivo median lethal concentration (LC50) values from 96-h acute toxicity studies with trout. In all 28 cases, the in vitro EC50 was within 18-fold of the in vivo LC50. These data help increase our understanding of the ecotoxicological domains of applicability for in vitro studies using cultured rainbow trout cells, while also demonstrating that these assays performed well in a 96-well format and have promise to yield data of biological relevance.

## Introduction

Toxicity  testing  regulations  in  jurisdictions  such  as  Canada (Environment  and  Climate  Change  Canada  [ECCC],  2007),  the United  States  (US  Environmentl  Protection  Agency  [USEPA], 1994), and the European Union (Hengstler et al., 2006) have long relied on fish to characterize the risk posed by chemical contaminants to aquatic ecosystem health. Although many toxicity tests involving fish are standardized and validated, they often require a considerable number of animals, are time-consuming, and produce  contaminated  waste  (Basu  et al., 2019;  Norberg-King et al., 2018; Tanneberger et al., 2013). In addition, standardized tests tend to focus on death as an endpoint, which provides little information on a chemical's mechanism of action and also raises ethical concerns. Such concerns, coupled with recent legislation in Canada, the United States, and the European Union working toward phasing out animal toxicity testing, are driving the development of alternatives to animal approaches.

Interest  in  New  Approach  Methodologies  (NAMs)  compliant with the three Rs principles (refinement, reduction, and replacement of animal testing) holds promise to overcome the limitations associated with animal-based toxicity testing. Toward this aim,  in  2021  the  Organization  for  Economic  Co-operation  and Development  (OECD,  2021)  standardized  and  published  test guideline 249 using gill cells from rainbow trout (RTgill-W1 cells) to  assess the cytotoxicity of chemicals (International Organization for Standardization, 2019; Lee et al., 2009). The gill cell was selected as the basis for OECD test guideline 249 because it plays a key role in the uptake of toxicants from water (Bury et al., 2014; Scott et al., 2021; Tanneberger et al., 2013). It also plays an important physiological role given its involvement in osmoregulation and respiration (Bury et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2009). The assay has been  demonstrated  to  be  repeatable  and  reproducible  (Fischer et al., 2019). Furthermore, studies with 35 organic chemicals and 38 fragrance chemicals showed that most median effect concentration (EC50) values were comparable to lethality values from studies on whole fish (Natsch et al., 2018; Tanneberger et al., 2013).

Despite  the  promise  of  this  test  method,  there  remain  outstanding  questions  that  warrant  further  research.  For  one, RTgill-W1  cells  represent  a  single  tissue  and  may  not  reflect responses in other tissues or in the whole organism. In a study of  three  rainbow  trout  cell  lines  (RTgill-W1,  along  with  liver

[RTL-W1]  and  intestine  [RTgutGC])  exposed  to  benzo[ a ]pyrene, metabolic capacity was evident in all cells although biotransformation  was  the  weakest  in  the  RTgill-W1  cells  (StadnickaMichalak  et  al.,  2018).  Cytotoxic  responses  differed  between RTgill-W1, RTL-W1, and RTgutGC cells following exposure to the synthetic dye Acid Blue 80 (Tee et al., 2011), although in a study of all three cell lines exposed to fluoxetine and methylmercury, many cytotoxic and transcriptomic responses were comparable (Mittal et al., 2022). Similarly, the RTgutGC cell line predicted cytotoxicity of 16 fragrance chemicals with an almost 1 to 1 relationship  to  the  RTgill-W1  cells  and  in  vivo  results  (Natsch et al., 2018; Schug et al., 2020).

Another aspect that warrants more consideration is the number of chemicals evaluated by rainbow trout cell lines. The published literature suggests that several dozens of chemicals have been tested for cytotoxicity in RTgill-W1 cells, such as fragrance chemicals (Natsch et al., 2018), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Bussolaro  et  al.,  2019),  nanobiomaterials  (Hern � andez-Moreno, Navas, et al.,  2022),  microplastics  (Boh � a � ckov � a  et  al.,  2023),  and biocides  (Hern � andez-Moreno,  Bl � azquez,  et  al.,  2022).  However, there is sparse or no representation from notable chemical classes such as pesticides.

Further increasing scientific confidence in OECD test guideline 249 will need to consider several factors (van der Zalm et al., 2022) including how this NAM performs: 1) under certain applicability  domains  (i.e.,  exposure  to  chemicals  with  diverse physicochemical properties and mechanisms of action); 2) technically  with  advances  to  the  method,  including  resource  efficiency  considerations  (e.g.,  shifting  from  24-well  to  96-well microplates, using two cell viability endpoints instead of three); and 3) in terms of biological relevance (i.e., how in vitro values compare with those in vivo; responses in RTgill-W1 cells vs. other rainbow  trout  cell  lines).  Accordingly,  the  overall  goal  of  our study was to characterize the cytotoxicity of 19 pesticides with comparable whole animal data, and diverse potencies and mechanisms  of  action  in  three  rainbow  trout  cell  lines  (RTgill-W1, RTL-W1,  and  RTgutGC).  Selected  pesticides  are  of  concern  in Canadian ecosystems (Anderson et al., 2021), and include herbicides (aminomethylphosphonic acid [AMPA], atrazine, dicamba, dimethenamid-P, diquat, glyphosate, imazethapyr, metolachlor, S-metolachlor, and metribuzin), insecticides (carbaryl, chlorantraniliprole,  chlorpyrifos,  clothianidin,  diazinon,  imidacloprid, permethrin,  and  thiamethoxam),  and  a  fungicide  (chlorothalonil). The first study objective was to compare intercell line cytotoxic  responses,  and  the  second  objective  was  to  correlate  the in vitro results with in vivo ones available from the literature.

## Methods

## Pesticide selection

Selection  of  the  19  pesticides  was  motivated  by  a  priority  list compiled  by  a  Fisheries  and  Oceans  Canada  study  (Anderson et al., 2021) that includes compounds used worldwide. Anderson et  al.  (2021)  identified  a  list  of  55  pesticides  and  ranked  them based on criteria such as 2017/2018 sales, detection frequency, measured concentrations in Canadian surface waters, inherent toxicity  from  guideline  values,  and  regulatory  status  in  other countries.  For  each  criterion,  pesticides  were  given  a  score  between 0 and 3, with a total of 33 points possible. Eight pesticides scored 23 points or more and were thus categorized as top priority; all eight are included in our study (atrazine, chlorothalonil, diazinon,  clothianidin,  chlorpyrifos,  diquat,  permethrin,  and S-metolachlor). Nine pesticides with scores ranging from 14 to 22

were  selected  to  cover  a  range  of  chemical  families,  physicochemical  properties,  and  mechanisms  of  action  (Supporting Information, Table S1). We also included chlorantraniliprole and AMPA. Chlorantraniloprole  was  selected  because  available  fish acute toxicity data are classified as 'nondefinitive' (USEPA, 2008). Aminomethylphosphonic acid was selected because it is a major metabolite of glyphosate, one of the most widely used herbicides worldwide (de Brito Rodrigues et al., 2019). Although glyphosate has  been  found  to  have  no  (or  low)  acute  toxic  in  fish  (Ant � on et al., 1994; de Brito Rodrigues et al., 2019; Folmar et al., 1979), literature gaps remain regarding AMPA and its toxicity to nontarget organisms (Tresnakova et al.,  2021).  Furthermore,  AMPA  has  a lower water solubility and a longer soil half-life than glyphosate, suggesting that it may be more persistent (Tresnakova et al., 2021).

## Rainbow trout cell culture

The  rainbow  trout  gill cell line  (RTgill-W1;  CRL-2523)  was obtained from American Type Cell Culture. The liver and intestinal cell lines (RTL-W1 and RTgutGC, respectively) were a kind donation  from  Dr.  Lucy  Lee  (University  of  the  Fraser  Valley, Abbotsford,  BC,  Canada).  All  cell  culturing  was  done  in  accordance with OECD test guideline 249 designed for RTgill-W1 cells. The culture of  these  RTL-W1 and  RTgutGC cell lines  following the OECD guideline was previously evaluated (Mittal et al., 2022; Schug et al., 2020) and deemed to be appropriate. In brief, cells were grown at 21 � C in 100-mm Petri dishes containing 10mL of complete culture medium (L-15; Leibovitz L-15 culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillinstreptomycin). The culture medium was replaced twice a week. Once cells  had  reached  80%  confluency,  they  were  trypsinized for 3 to 5 min using 1 mL of trypsin-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid,  and  either  passaged  to  continue  the  culture  or  counted (using a hemocytometer) and seeded in 96-well plates (Falcon 96well, Cat. No. 08-772-2C; Fischer Scientific) for exposure experiments (35,000 cells/well). The cell passage number ranged from 64 to 71 for RTgill-W1 cells, 77 to 79 for the RTgutGC cells, and 82 to 84 for the RTL-W1 cells.

## Chemicals

The cells were exposed to pesticides according to the methods described in OECD test guideline 249 with minor changes (largely due to optimizing the assay for 96-well plates, and these are described  in  the  following  section, Exposure ).  Pesticides  were  purchased  from  Sigma-Aldrich  except  for  metolachlor,  diazinon, permethrin,  and  S-metolachlor,  which  were  purchased  from Canadian  Life  Science,  and  chlorpyrifos,  which  was  purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals (see Supporting Information, Table S1 for details such as CAS and lot numbers, chemical classifications,  and  physicochemical  properties).  For  cytotoxicity studies,  200-mM stock solutions were created for all pesticides except  glyphosate  (20 mM)  and  chlorothalonil  (20 mM),  which were created at lower concentrations due to solubility issues. All stock  solutions  were  prepared  in  dimethyl  sulfoxide  (DMSO; Sigma-Aldrich), except for diquat, AMPA, and glyphosate, which were prepared in Milli-Q water. The stock solutions were serially diluted (threefold) in L-15 exposure medium (L-15/ex; a specifically designed protein- and animal-component-free buffer that provides optimal pH and osmolality between 7 and 7.5 and 290 and 320mmol/kg, respectively, for the cells during their chemical exposures)  to  obtain  final  test  concentrations  of  0,  0.45,  1.37, 4.12, 12.35, 37.04, 111.11, 333.33, and 1000 μ M for chlorothalonil, or 0, 0.05, 0.14, 0.41, 1.24, 3.7, 11.11, 33.33, and 100 μ M for glyphosate (due to their stock solutions being made 10-fold lower than

the other pesticides). The OECD test guideline 249 positive control  chemical  (3,4-dichloroaniline  [3,4-DCA];  Fisher  Scientific) was prepared fresh on the day of exposure in DMSO and diluted in L-15/ex to obtain the following concentrations: 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 mg/L. Water and DMSO were added to L-15/ex at a final concentration of 0.5% v/v.

## Exposure

The OECD test guideline 249 protocol was modified slightly in a few ways to increase efficiency. First, the test provides guidance on  testing  one  chemical  in  a  24-well  plate  over  six  concentrations.  To  increase the  throughput potential of this method, we scaled the method to perform in a 96-well plate so that it could test 10 chemicals over eight concentrations in a single plate while also  retaining  quality  control  wells.  Performance  of  this  OECD test  in  96-well  plates  has  previously  been  done  (Hern � andezMoreno,  Navas,  et  al.,  2022).  Second,  two  cell  viability  dyes (alamarBlue for assessing metabolic activity and 5-carboxyfluorescein  diacetate  acetoxymethyl  ester  [CFDA-AM]  for  assessing cell membrane integrity) were used to assess cytotoxicity as opposed  to  the  three  dyes  outlined  in  the  OECD  test  (including Neutral Red for assessing lysosomal membrane integrity). This was decided because alamarBlue and CFDA-AM solutions can be combined  and  applied  to  cells  as  one  solution  (OECD,  2021), which represents a more resource-efficient option. Furthermore, previous  results  have  shown  high  intercorrelation  among  the three dyes, and that the use of one dye (alamarBlue) might be sufficient (Natsch et al., 2018; Tanneberger et al., 2013). Third, as previously  mentioned,  the  applicability  of  OECD  test  guideline 249 has been explored with liver and gut rainbow trout cell lines (Mittal et al., 2022; Schug et al., 2020), and these cells were included in the present study alongside the gill cells for comparative  purposes  and  to  further  explore  biological  relevance  and domains of applicability.  Finally,  OECD  test  guideline  249  calls for exposure solutions to be taken to verify actual chemical concentrations, although the transition to a 96-well plate limits the ability  to  perform  chemical  analysis  due  to  the  lower  volume (1.5 mL in a 24-well plate vs. 100 μ L in a 96-well plate), so this aspect was omitted. However, attempts were made to model the disposition  of  chemicals  in  exposure  media  using  the  In  Vitro Mass Balance Model Equilibrium Partitioning (IV-MBM EQP) Ver. 2.1 as described further in the Mass balance modeling section.

A series of pilot tests was conducted to ensure that the quality control criteria described in OECD test guideline 249 as well as the  expected  cytotoxicity  results  would  not  be  affected  by  this transition. It was determined that seeding 35,000 cells/well in a 96-well plate format (as opposed to 350,000 cells/well in a 24-well plate  format)  would  satisfy  three  quality  control  checks  while not  changing  the  cytotoxicity  results  (Supporting  Information, Figure S1 and Table S2). In addition, a pilot test with metolachlor in  24-  and  96-well  plates  with  the  alamarBlue  fluorescent  dye was performed to ensure that results would not differ in the latter  format  (Supporting  Information,  Figure  S2).  The  RTgill-W1 cells exposed to metolachlor in a 24-well plate over a concentration range of 0.01 to 1000 μ M (twofold serial dilution over six concentrations)  yielded  a  median  lethal  concentration  (LC50)  of 291.2 μ M  (82.6-499.7 μ M),  and  the  RTgill-W1  cells  exposed  to metolachlor  in  a  96-well  plate  resulted  in  an  LC50  of  311.7 μ M (108.9-514.4 μ M; Supporting Information, Figure S2). These results provide confidence that the assay can be scalable for a 96-well format.

In  terms  of  the  exposure  study  design,  each  pesticide  was tested in each of the three cell lines at eight concentrations (as well as a negative control) spanning approximately 3.5 orders of

magnitude.  For  each  of  the  cell  lines,  three  different  passages were tested against each pesticide and these exposures were performed  in  different  microplates.  To  keep  the  exposure  design consistent, the 19 pesticides were split into 'batch 1' chemicals consisting of 9 pesticides and 3,4-DCA, and 'batch 2' chemicals consisting of the subsequent 10 pesticides (Supporting Information, Figure S1B).

On exposure Day 1, cells were seeded at a density of 35,000 cells/100 μ L of complete medium/well in 96-well plates and incubated for 24 h. In each plate, 11 wells were designated as no-cell controls and contained only the complete medium. On Day 2, the complete  medium  was  discarded  and  replaced  with  100 μ L  of L-15/ex for the negative control (one well), or L-15/ex containing either the pesticide, solvent (DMSO), or positive control (3,4-DCA) at  appropriate  concentrations  (one concentration/well).  The highest concentrations of the pesticide stocks and 3,4-DCA were added to the wells and then serially diluted (threefold) in L-15/ex. Ten of the 11 no-cell control wells received the highest concentration  of  chemicals,  and  the  other  well  received  L-15/ex.  The cells were then incubated for 24 h. On Day 3, the exposure medium was discarded, and the alamarBlue and (CFDA-AM) cytotoxicity assays were conducted immediately to assess metabolic activity  and  membrane  integrity,  respectively.  Briefly,  the  cells were rinsed in 100 μ L of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) following which alamarBlue (5% v/v in PBS) þ CFDA-AM dye was added to the wells, and the cells were incubated for 30 min. Next, fluorescence was read at 530nm/595nm for alamarBlue and 493nm/ 541nm for CFDA-AM using a Synergy HT Gen5 microplate reader (BioTek). Concentration-response curves of the tested pesticides are reported as percentage viability. Percentage viability is based on the fluorescence units (FU) of the treated cells compared with the DMSO-solvent control fluorescence units based on the equation below:

The  EC50  value  was  calculated  using  the  drc  package  for dose-response analysis in R. All EC50 data are reported as mean ±SD values.

## Mass balance modeling

Physicochemical properties, specifically hydrophobicity and volatility,  of  test  chemicals  complicate  the  comparison  of  toxicity values  between  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  assay  results  (Dupraz et  al.,  2019;  Schug  et  al.,  2020;  Stadnicka-Michalak  et  al.,  2014; Tanneberger et al., 2013). To help overcome this challenge, OECD test guideline 249 recommends performing chemical analysis at the start and end of an experiment. However chemical measures are not always possible due to technical, logistical, and financial barriers (such as in the present study),  and  so  modeling approaches have emerged to help calculate biologically effective doses in vitro (Armitage et al., 2021; Stadnicka-Michalak et al., 2021). A modeling framework was developed by StadnickaMichalak et al. (2021) for RTgill-W1 cells but could not be used here because the model was built for 24- and 48-well plates, and our study used 96-well plates. Instead, we used IV-MBM EQP Ver. 2.1,  which  is  a  mass  balance  model  compatible  with  96-well in vitro studies that predicts chemical concentrations in the medium  and  intracellular  environment  (Armitage  et  al.,  2021).  A good correlation  was  observed  between  IV-MBM  EQP-predicted concentrations  and  analytically  measured  concentrations  from four  different  in  vitro  cell-based  studies  involving  a  variety  of

|

chemicals ( R 2 between 0.69 and 0.84; Armitage et al., 2021), including S-metolachlor, glyphosate, AMPA, chlorpyrifos, and imidacloprid. The model is implemented as an Excel/VBA spreadsheet  tool  and  is  available  for  download  at  ARC  Arnot Research and Consulting (2023).

## In vitro-in vivo comparisons

Comparisons were made between the in vitro EC50 data we derived (both nominal and predicted concentrations) with in vivo LC50 values drawn from the scientific literature. The OECD test guideline 249 states that the EC50 of the most sensitive endpoint (i.e.,  the  lower EC50 between metabolic activity and membrane integrity  endpoints)  can  be  used  to  predict  the  in  vivo  LC50 (OECD,  2021),  so  this  value  was  determined  for  each  pesticide and used for in vitro -in  vivo  comparisons.  In  vivo  LC50  values were taken from 96-h acute toxicity studies with juvenile rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ) from the USEPA's (2023) Ecotoxicology  Knowledgebase  (ECOTOX),  the  EnviroTox  (2023) database, and peer-reviewed journals if no database value was available. Inclusion criteria for the selection of in vivo values included:  96 h  exposure,  tests  performed  with  active  ingredient (not  formulation),  a  chemical  purity  of  more  than  80%,  LC50 value calculated, and use of flow-through or static systems. All pesticides,  except  for  permethrin  and  carbaryl,  returned  one LC50 value from the databases. Three database LC50 values were obtained  for  permethrin,  and  these  were  averaged.  Carbaryl's LC50 value was taken from a published study that satisfied inclusion  criteria  (Dwyer  et  al.,  2005).  In  vivo -in  vitro  correlations were  performed  using  a  Spearman's  rank ρ coefficient  test where α ¼ 0.05.

## Results Quality control

Quality control data are outlined in the Supporting Information (Tables S3 and S4) with key findings summarized in the present study.  Across  all  batches  of  all  cell  lines,  cell  viability  of  the DMSO solvent  control  ranged  from  90.5%  to  109.0%  compared with the negative (unexposed) controls except for RTgutGC cell Batch 1 exposures (87.4%). The variation in the cell-free control well was below 20% for most pesticides (except for glyphosate, diquat,  and  chlorothalonil).  The  positive  control  3,4-DCA  was tested  with  every  passage  and  elicited  concentration-response curves for the RTgill-W1 cells with aaverage EC50 values of 57.7 ± 4.5 and 62.0 ± 6.3 mg/L for the alamarBlue and CFDA-AM cell viability  dyes,  respectively  (Supporting  Information,  Figure  S3). Combined, these results satisfy most quality control criteria outlined in OECD test guideline 249, thus indicating that the assay (which we adapted in our study for a 96-well format) was performing well.

## Mass balance modeling

Using the IV-MBM EQP Ver. 2.1 model, and in consideration of the test chemicals and in vitro assay parameters, the predicted concentration  of  chemicals  in  the  culture  medium  ranged  from 0.01% to 99.8% of the nominal concentration (Supporting Information S1, Table S5). For seven pesticides (glyphosate, diquat, AMPA, thiamethoxam, imidacloprid, clothianidin, and imazethapyr),  the  predicted  concentration  was  within  10%  of  the nominal  one.  Dicamba,  metribuzin,  and  dimethenamid-P  were predicted to have 82% to 89% of chemical available in the test system. Five pesticides (carbaryl, atrazine, S-metolachlor, metolachlor, and diazinon) were predicted to have between 19.5% and 55% of the test concentration available in the medium. Finally, levels  of  chlorantraniliprole,  chlorothalonil,  chlorpyrifos,  and permethrin were predicted to be &lt; 3% of the nominal value. With increasing hydrophobicity (i.e., log octanol/water partition coefficient [ K OW]) of a particular chemical, the predicted concentration in the cell culture media decreased (Supporting Information S1, Figure S4). Throughout the present study, the exposure data are presented and discussed in terms of both nominal and modelpredicted concentrations.

## Cell line results

## RTgill-W1 results

For  RTgill-W1  cells,  concentration-response  curves  and  corresponding EC50 values were obtained for 10 of the 19 pesticides (Table 1) assessing metabolic activity (Figure 1) and 7 of the 19 pesticides assessing membrane integrity (Figure 2), for a total of 11  pesticides  being  classified  as  cytotoxic  to  these  gill  cells. Diquat, AMPA, dicamba, and imazethapyr (all herbicides) were cytotoxic for metabolic activity but not for membrane integrity, whereas the opposite was observed with permethrin (insecticide). Six pesticides elicited a response for both cell viability endpoints, and of  these  six,  all  except  carbaryl  and  dimethenamid-P  produced similar values (within 95% confidence intervals [CI]). The rank-order, for most to least cytotoxic based on the most sensitive  EC50  value  calculated  from  the  nominal  concentrations, was:  chlorothalonil &gt; carbaryl &gt; diquat &gt; chlorpyrifos &gt; dimethenamid-P &gt; metolachlor &gt; S-metolachlor &gt; dicamba &gt; permethrin &gt; AMPA &gt; imazethapyr. However, when the EC50 data were considered using the predicted concentrations, the order changed  so  that  permethrin,  chlorothalonil,  and  chlorpyrifos were ranked most potent, with EC50 values below approximately 1 μ M followed by  carbaryl  and  diquat,  with  EC50  values  below 100 μ M (Table 1).

## RTL-W1 results

In the liver cells, EC50 values were obtained for nine pesticides (Table 1). Seven of the nine pesticides (chlorpyrifos, chlorothalonil,  carbaryl,  metolachlor, S-metolachlor, dimethenamid-P, and diquat) were cytotoxic with both cell viability endpoints (Figures 1 and 2). Aminomethylphosphonic acid was only cytotoxic with metabolic activity, and permethrin was only cytotoxic with membrane integrity. The rank order, for most to least toxic based  on  the  lowest  EC50  values  calculated  from  the  nominal concentrations, was: chlorothalonil &gt; diquat &gt; carbaryl &gt; chlorpyrifos &gt; metolachlor &gt; S-metolachlor &gt; dimethenamid-P &gt; AMPA &gt; permethrin. However, when the EC50 data were considered using the predicted concentrations, the order changed in a manner nearly identical to that of the RTgill-W1 cells given in the previous section, RTgill-W1 cell results .

## RTgutGC results

In the intestinal cells, eight pesticides (chlorpyrifos, chlorothalonil,  carbaryl,  metolachlor,  S-metolachlor,  dimethenamid-P,  diquat,  and  chlorantraniliprole)  elicited  concentration-response curves and LC50 values for both cell viability assays (Figures 1 and 2). The rank-order for most to least toxic, based on the most sensitive  EC50s  calculated  from  the  nominal  concentrations, was: chlorothalonil &gt; diquat &gt; carbaryl &gt; dimethenamid-P &gt; metolachlor &gt; S-metolachlor &gt; chlorpyrifos &gt; chlorantraniliprole (Table 1). However, when the EC50 data were considered using the predicted concentrations, the order changed so that chlorothalonil, chlorpyrifos, and chlorantraniliprole were ranked most potent, with EC50 values below approximately 1.5 μ M followed by carbaryl and diquat, with values below 100 μ M.

## Intercell line comparisons

Some common trends in cytotoxicity were observed across the three cell lines. First, a visual inspection of a principal components analysis plot shows separation between the cytotoxic and noncytotoxic  pesticides  (Supporting  Information  S1,  Figure  S5). Second,  seven  pesticides  (chlorpyrifos,  chlorothalonil,  carbaryl, metolachlor, S-metolachlor, dimethenamid-P, and diquat) were cytotoxic to all three cell lines (Table 1). Six of these pesticides (chlorpyrifos,  chlorothalonil,  carbaryl,  metolachlor,  S-metolachlor,  and  dimethenamid-P)  were  cytotoxic  across  all  the  cell lines  according to both cell viability endpoints, whereas diquat did  not  yield  a  concentration-response  curve  in  the  RTgill-W1 cell line via the membrane integrity assay. Third, the top three toxic  pesticides  in  all  three  cell  lines  (based  on  the  predicted

concentrations) always included chlorpyrifos and chlorothalonil. When the EC50 data were examined based on nominal concentrations, the top three toxic pesticides in all three cell lines were consistently ranked differently as chlorothalonil &gt; diquat &gt; carbaryl. Fourth, of the seven pesticides that were cytotoxic in all three cell lines, chlorpyrifos, chlorothalonil, carbaryl, and S-metolachlor ( n ¼ 4) produced EC50 ( µ M) values from metabolic activity and membrane integrity endpoints within 95% CI of each other. Lastly,  no  cytotoxic  responses were  observed in any cell line for seven pesticides (three herbicides: atrazine, glyphosate, and  metribuzin;  and  four  insecticides:  diazinon,  clothianidin, thiamethoxam, and imidacloprid).

There  were  also  notable  differences  among  the  cell  lines and endpoints with key examples  provided in our study.

The RTgill-W1 cell line yielded the most concentration-response curves  (with  11  of  the  19  pesticides  yielding  EC50  values),  followed by the RTL-W1 (9 pesticides) and RTgutGC cell lines (8 pesticides). Aminomethylphosphonic acid and permethrin demonstrated tissue and endpoint sensitivity in which they only elicited EC50 values with the metabolic activity and membrane integrity endpoints, respectively, for the RTgill-W1 and RTL-W1 cell lines. Neither of these pesticides caused cytotoxicity in the RTgutGC cell line. Tissue specificity was also observed with dicamba, imazethapyr, and chlorantraniliprole. Dicamba and imazethapyr only caused a cytotoxic response in the RTgill-W1 cells, and chlorantraniliprole was only cytotoxic to the RTgutGC cell line. Finally, across all cell lines, diquat was found to be more cytotoxic according to the metabolic activity endpoint versus the membrane integrity endpoint.

## In vitro-in vivo comparisons

In the dataset, 57 cell line-pesticide combinations were tested of which 28 yielded cytotoxic responses up to test concentrations that were either 100 or 1000 μ M (Table 1). Across these 28 cytotoxicity cases, 13 yielded in vitro EC50 values based on nominal concentrations that were within 1 order of magnitude of the corresponding  in  vivo  LC50  values,  10  were  within  30-fold,  and chlorpyrifos and permethrin yielded results &gt; 2000-fold. However, when the in vitro EC50 values were adjusted to reflect their predicted concentrations, 23 of them yielded in vitro EC50 values that were within 1 order of magnitude of the corresponding in vivo LC50 values, and all 28 cases yielded EC50 values that were within 18-fold of the in vivo value.

Correlations between the EC50 values we derived in vitro with lethality values from rainbow trout fish exposures (derived from the  literature)  were  calculated.  Although  correlations  using in vitro EC50 values based on nominal concentrations did not return statistically significant results, with the exception of some borderline  associations  within  RTgill-W1  cells  (Figure  3  and Supporting Information, Figures S6 and S7 and Table S6), correlation calculations between in vivo LC50 and in vitro EC50 values from the most sensitive endpoint based on predicted concentrations were significant for the RTgill-W1 (Spearman ρ value ¼ 0.94, p value &lt; 0.0001, r 2 ¼ 0.88) and RTL-W1 (Spearman ρ value ¼ 0.86, p value ¼ 0.0028, r 2 ¼ 0.84)  cell  lines  (Figure  3  and  Supporting Information, Figure S8). For the RTgutGC, the Spearman p correlation  was  not  of  statistical  significance  (Spearman ρ value  of 0.46, p value ¼ 0.26, r 2 ¼ 0.54). Although our results focus on concentrations reported on a molar basis, corresponding in vitro and in vivo values on  a mass  basis  (mg/L) are also  provided (Supporting Information, Table S7).

Using model predicted concentrations (vs. nominal ones) that consider physicochemical variables resulted in EC50 values that were more closely aligned with mortality data from 96-h rainbow trout bioassays. In the present study, when cytotoxicity was measured,  we  observed  that  the  log  air/water  partition  coefficient ( K AW) correlated with EC50 values in RTgill-W1 and RTL-W1 but not RTgutGC cell lines (Supporting Information, Figure S9). Weak nonsignificant  correlations  (i.e., p ¼ 0.1)  were  also  observed  in some cases for log H ,  water solubility, and log K OW  (Supporting Information, Figures S10-S12), although, overall, when data were considered for all chemicals (cytotoxic and noncytotoxic ones), there were no clear patterns.

## Discussion

The overall objective of our study was to increase an understanding of the ecotoxicological domains of applicability (i.e.,

Correlation of nominal (blue triangle) median effect concentration (EC50) values and model predicted (pink circle) EC50s from the most sensitive endpoint for ( A ) rainbow trout (RT)gill-W1; ( B ) RTL-W1, and ( C ) RTgutGC cell lines. Only cytotoxic pesticides were included in our study. The in vivo median lethal concentration (LC50) values ( y -axis) for rainbow trout were obtained from database and literature sources. The solid pink line (predicted EC50s) and dashed blue line (nominal EC50s) represent the lines of best fit. The equations that best represent the nominal and predicted EC50 correlations are presented on each plot for each cell line.

performance  against  pesticides with varying potencies  and mechanisms  of  action)  for  cultured  rainbow  trout  cells,  while also determining whether the assay performed well technically

in a 96-well format and yielded data of biological relevance (i.e., how  do  in  vitro  values  compare  with  those  in  vivo).  This  was addressed through a study of diverse pesticides of ecological concern that differed in their class (10 herbicides, eight insecticides, and one fungicide), target  receptors  and/or  mechanisms of  action, hydrophobicity (log K OW  from -3.75 to 6.1), volatility (log H -15.5 to -1.3), and water solubility (from 0.2 mg/L to 1.5 × 10 6 mg/L). In doing so, we demonstrate that 11 of the 19 pesticides tested were cytotoxic to RTgill-W1 cells, whereas 9 and 8 were cytotoxic to  the  RTL-W1  and  RTgutGC  cells,  respectively. Select herbicides (metolachlor, S-metolachlor, dimethenamid-P, and diquat), insecticides (chlorpyrifos and carbaryl), and a fungicide (chlorothalonil) were cytotoxic to all three cell lines.

In all cases in which we measured cytotoxicity, EC50 values (based on model-predicted concentrations in the culture media) were within 18-fold of the in vivo LC50 values. In 82% of these cases, the EC50 value was within 10-fold (1 order of magnitude) of  the  corresponding  in  vivo  LC50  value.  This  level  of  concordance is comparable to a past RTgill-W1 cell study of 35 organic chemicals (with diverse physicochemical properties and modes of  action)  in  which  approximately  73%  of  the  test  chemicals yielded EC50 values that were within fivefold of the in vivo one (Tanneberger  et  al.,  2013);  for  comparative  purposes,  approximately 57% of derived EC50s in the present study were within fivefold of in vivo values, although this was 73% for the RTgillW1 cell results. Reasons for discrepancies between in vitro and in vivo results are detailed below, and may relate to the class of chemical  under  investigation,  mechanisms  underpinning  bioavailability  and  toxic  action,  study  design  (e.g.,  96-well  plates with  model-predicted  concentrations  vs.  24-well  plates  with measured concentrations in Tanneberger et al., 2013), and variability with the in vivo LC50 values, which largely hail from single studies.

Most of the cytotoxic pesticides in the present study were classified as herbicides. All 10 herbicides tested, except for atrazine, metribuzin, and glyphosate, caused cytotoxicity in at least one experiment. Perhaps it is not surprising that atrazine and metribuzin did not cause cytotoxicity in any of the three cell lines because their  target  mode  of  action  (inhibiting  photosystem  II  in photosynthesis) is a structure not found in animal cells (Anderson  et  al.,  2021;  Retzinger  &amp;  Mallory-Smith,  1997).  For glyphosate, some studies have characterized cytotoxicity in fish cells,  although at concentrations much higher than in the present study. (The highest concentration tested in our study was 1mM, which is equivalent to 169.1mg/L.) For example, in RTLW1 cells,  cytotoxic  responses  were  observed  at  concentrations above 250mg/L following exposure to technical-grade glyphosate (Santos et al., 2019). Although we did not find glyphosate to be cytotoxic, its metabolite AMPA caused cytotoxicity in the gill and liver cells at approximately 500 µ M.

Of the eight insecticides we studied, chlorpyrifos and carbaryl yielded EC50 values in all cell lines, with permethrin and chlorantraniliprole  yielding  selective  responses.  Permethrin  disrupts neuronal function in insects and nontarget organisms by interfering with voltage-gated sodium channels (USEPA, 2007; Silver et al., 2014). In the present study, this compound only elicited a response  with  the  membrane  integrity  endpoint  (CFDA-AM)  in RTgill-W1 and RTL-W1 cell lines. This is consistent with previous RTgill-W1 cell studies of permethrin in which membrane integrity was a more sensitive endpoint than metabolic activity (metabolic activity of 426.7 µ M; Scott et al., 2021; Tanneberger et al., 2013). Divergent responses were also found for two organophosphate insecticides (chlorpyrifos and diazinon) with a

|

common mechanism of toxicity (Harper et al., 2009). In the present study, chlorpyrifos was cytotoxic in all three trout cell lines at concentrations of ≥ 100 μ M, while diazinon was not cytotoxic in any  of  the  cells  at  concentrations  up  to  1 mM.  Similarly,  in  a study of human bronchial epithelial (A549) cells and immortalized  T-lymphocytes  (jurkat)  cells,  chlorpyrifos  was  cytotoxic  at concentrations  of ≥ 250 μ M,  but  diazinon  was  not  toxic  up  to 1mM (Oostingh et al., 2009). The remaining insecticides classified as noncytotoxic in the present study (clothianidin, imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam) are neonicotinoids with high selectivity for insect neural nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (Ihara &amp; Matsuda, 2018). This specificity may not be captured by gill, liver, and gut cell lines. This sentiment is one that is reflected in the OECD test guideline 249 document, in which the gill cell has been described as not being well suited to study neurotoxic chemicals that  act  through  specific  ion  channels  or  receptors  typically found in the brain (OECD, 2021).

The one fungicide we studied, chlorothalonil, was among the top  three  most  toxic  compounds tested,  with EC50  values  that ranged  from  approximately  1  to  3 µ M  across  all  cell  lines. Chlorothalonil  has  been  determined  to  be  acutely  toxic  to  fish in vivo (Anderson et al., 2021; Stebbins &amp; Lin, 2020). It acts as a protectant fungicide that deactivates thiols, in particular glutathione, to prevent fungal spore germination, respiration, and glycolysis  (Stebbins  &amp;  Lin,  2020).  Glutathione  is  a  well-conserved antioxidant  across  phyla,  so  toxicity  in  nontarget  species  is not surprising.

Of  the  57  cell  line-pesticide  combinations  studied  here,  28 yielded cytotoxic responses (up to test concentrations that were either 100 or 1000 μ M). However, this also means that approximately 50% of the cell line-pesticide combinations did not yield a cytotoxicity  value  even  though  all  the  pesticides  in  our  study have lethality data in vivo. Many of these exceptions were discussed  previously.  The  presence  of  false  negatives  could  be driven by the lack of in vivo biological processes, physicochemical properties of the test compounds, or study design considerations. Of the seven pesticides that caused no cytotoxicity in the three cell lines,  five (glyphosate, metribuzin, clothianidin, thiamethoxam, and imidacloprid) had in vivo LC50 values that were above approximately 300 μ M or within one-third of the highest test concentration. Perhaps testing higher concentrations in vitro would  have  yielded  cytotoxic  outcomes  values.  Regardless,  for assays like the ones studied here to be confidently applied, there needs to be a global understanding of when it may yield accurate and relevant data, and when it may not.

Our results indicate divergent cell-line-specific results for several  pesticides.  This  is  in  contrast  to  Schug  et  al.  (2020),  who found a nearly 1 to 1 correlation between gill and gut results for 16  fragrance  chemicals  with  similar  modes  of  action.  Gill  cells represent  an  important  site  for  toxicant  uptake  via  water, whereas the gut cell has been discussed as a viable model for hydrophobic chemicals that sorb to organic matter and could enter the  fish  through  a  dietary  route.  The  pesticides  we  evaluated have differing  modes  of  toxic  action  and  vast  physicochemical properties that could affect cells differently, which could explain the more variable nature of our study versus that of Schug et al. (2020).  The  relationships  among  physicochemical  properties (log K AW, log H , log K OW) and EC50 values for the pesticides studied varied across the three cell lines, and the data may be repurposed by others to help increase our understanding of chemical domains of applicability for different trout cells.

The  present  study  was  motivated  by  the  establishment  of OECD  test  guideline  249  using  RTgill-W1  cells  to  assess  the

|

cytotoxicity of chemicals, along with growing regulatory and scientific interest in NAMs. Assay formalization under the OECD is a rigorous undertaking, and so it is not surprising that this assay is technically  sound  (Fischer  et  al.,  2019)  and  yields  cytotoxicity data that are comparable to lethality values in vivo (Tanneberger et  al.,  2013).  Although  the  method  has  been  approved  by  the OECD, for  it  to  gain  widespread  implementation  more  demonstrative  case  studies,  such  as  the  present  study,  are  needed. Building  scientific  confidence  in  a  NAM  must  be  viewed  as  an evolving and iterative process, and thus needs to consider several factors, as outlined by van der Zalm et al. (2022). In terms of technical performance, we have demonstrated that the RTgill-W1 cytotoxicity assay performed well in a 96-well microplate format by comparing  several  quality  control  measures  with  expectations outlined in OECD test guideline 249, and comparing 96-well plate cytotoxicity  results  with  results  from  24-well  plates.  Thus  our study highlights the potential of this assay for higher throughput applications. We further extended this analysis to also show that technically good measures can also be yielded from the RTL-W1 and  RTgutGC  cell  lines  studied  in  96-well  microplates.  Such results with these cell lines are not surprising given that several researchers have previously demonstrated  that cytotoxicity assays  in  these  cell  lines  yield  quality  and  robust  data  (Dayeh et  al.,  2005;  Mittal  et  al.,  2022;  Natsch  et  al.,  2018;  Schug et al., 2020).

An ultimate question in the present study was whether the in vitro data could be used to predict in vivo outcomes. When cytotoxicity  was  measured  and  considered  in  terms  of  nominal concentration  in  the  microplate  well,  the  associations  with in  vivo  adverse  outcomes  (from  databases  and  the  literature) were  weak  or  nonexistent.  Ideally,  chemical  concentrations  in the well should be determined, although this it was not possible in  the  present  study  due  to  technical,  logistical,  and  financial barriers further reinforced by the relatively small volumes in 96well microplates. This remains a major limitation of our study that  warrants  future  attention.  Nonetheless,  when  our  in  vitro concentration data were modeled using the IV-MBM EQP Ver. 2.1 model (Armitage et al., 2021) to yield predicted values within the cell  culture  media,  the  resulting  comparisons  between  the in vitro and in vivo data were considerably strengthened. Other researchers studying rainbow trout cells have highlighted the importance of considering physicochemical properties and modeling  approaches  when  comparing  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  data (Dupraz  et  al.,  2019;  Schug  et  al.,  2020;  Stadnicka-Michalak et al., 2014; Tanneberger et al., 2013), which is reinforced by our present analysis.
