Summary - Pyrethroids are the most widely used insecticides for indoor pest control, so human exposure to them is common. The main target of pyrethroids is the nervous system, but their endocrine disrupting capabilities may also be of toxicological concern. In the present study, the proliferation of the breast cancer cell line, MCF7, was studied after a 7-day exposure to various concentrations of pyrethrin, permethrin and  cypermethrin.  The  effects  of  oestradiol  and  the  combined  effects  of  oestradiol  (0.10nM)  and pyrethroids (0.1-100 µ M) on MCF7 cell proliferation were also evaluated. Proliferation and cell toxicity were studied by measuring the ATP content with a luminescence method, and mitochondrial metabolic enzyme activity with the WST-1 test. In the ATP test, low concentrations (0.1-1 µ M) of pyrethroids in co-exposure with oestradiol caused a clear statistically significant increase in the proliferation of MCF7 cells. This was evident when compared to the proliferative effect caused by 0.1nM oestradiol alone. High concentrations were cytotoxic, and the greatest cell toxicity was that of cypermethrin, which has a cyano group in its molecular structure.

Key words : cell proliferation, cypermethrin, endocrine disruption, MCF7 cell line, oestradiol, permethrin, pyrethrin.

## Introduction

Natural pyrethrins and their synthetic homologues form  an  important  group  of  insecticides,  with  a worldwide commercial production. Their use to control harmful insects in agriculture and gardening is considerable,  and  human  exposure  to  pyrethroid compounds  is  common.  The  main  advantages  of pyrethroids are low mammalian toxicity and rapid biodegradation. The soil does not absorb pyrethroids, but they are of toxicological concern in natural water ecosystems.

Natural pyrethrin is an extract from the flowers of Chrysanthemum spp., and it is a mixture of chemically related pyrethrins. It was used extensively until World War II. Since then, many synthetic pyrethroids with  better  light  stability,  activity  and  safety  have been  developed.  Some  of  the  synthetic  compounds differ significantly from the original structure of natural pyrethrins. Depending on their chemical structures,  pyrethroids  can  produce  various  symptoms. Pyrethroid  compounds  are  neurotoxins,  and  cause neuronal hyperexcitability in the central nervous system. The primary target for pyrethroid compounds is the sodium channel in the neural cell membrane (1, 2).

Hormonal homeostasis has also been shown to change following exposure to pyrethroids.

Colborn and coworkers (3) have listed pyrethroids  as  endocrine-disrupting  chemicals. Endocrine disrupters are of special environmental  concern.  Exposure  to  certain  endocrine  disrupters can alter the endocrine system, increase the risk of endocrine diseases and disorders, and affect  development  in  both  humans  and  wildlife (3,  4).  Hormones  and  hormone-like  compounds are already effective at low dose levels. Exposure to hormonally active agents may represent a risk at  extremely  low  levels,  particularly  during  the sensitive periods of fetal development. Thus, it is not surprising that there is evidence of a strong association between fetal death due to congenital anomalies and residential exposure to pyrethroids  (a  5-fold  risk  during  weeks  3-8  of pregnancy;  5).  Earlier  discussions  have  mainly focused  on  the  neurotoxic  characteristics  of pyrethroids, but other mechanisms of pyrethroid toxicity should be given greater consideration (6).

In the present study, we investigated the cytotoxicity and interaction with oestradiol of various commercial pyrethroid products: pyrethrin (no alpha-cyano  group,  Biospray  S),  permethrin  (no alpha-cyano group, Biokill) and cypermethrin (with the  alpha-cyano  group,  Ripcord)  in  MCF7  human breast carcinoma cell cultures.

## Materials and Methods

## Test compounds

Three  commercial  pyrethroid  products,  namely, Biospray  S  (Kemira,  Helsinki,  Finland),  Biokill (Jesmond, Zurich, Switzerland) and Ripcord (American Cyanamid Company, USA), were used as test  compounds.  Biospray  S  contained  an  active compound, 100g/l pyrethrin, Biokill contained 2.5g/l permethrin, and Ripcord 100g/l cypermethrin, with an 820g/l mixture of xylene and petrol.

## Materials

75cm 2 Nunc (Roskilde, Denmark) flasks (Cat. No. 156472)  and  Nunclon  96-well  plates  (Cat.  No. 167008) were used for the cell cultures. The cell culture reagents were as follows: Dulbecco's modified Eagles's medium:nutrient mixture  F12  Ham (DMEM/F12) medium (high glucose with 2.5mM Lglutamine), with phenol red; antibiotic/antimycotic solution  (Gibco;  Paisley,  UK);  fetal  bovine  serum (FBS; Gibco); dextran-coated charcoal serum (DCC; Gibco); insulin (Sigma); and 17β oestradiol (Sigma).  All  the  reagents  used  were  of  analytical grade.  Black  microwell  plates  for  luminometric measurements came from ThermoLabsystems. The ThermoLabsystems (St Louis, MO, USA) bioluminescent assay for ATP was used.

## Culture of MCF7 cells

The human breast carcinoma cell line, MCF7, was purchased  from  the  American  Type  Culture Collection  (ATCC;  Rockville,  MD,  USA).  This epithelial-type  cell  line  originates  from  a  mammary gland adenocarcinoma. MCF7 cells were cultured according to the instructions of the ATCC, in high-glucose  DMEM/F12  medium  with  10%  FBS and 10ng/ml insulin. The cells were split 1:4 when nearly confluent (80%). MCF7 cells were seeded at a density of 5000 cells/well on 96-microwell plates, in 100ml medium  per well, and grown in DMEM/F12  medium  with  100U/ml  penicillin, 100 µ g/ml  streptomycin,  10ng/ml  insulin,  and  5% DCC  serum.  The  cells  were  then  grown  for  24 hours at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2.

## Exposure of MCF7 cells

Natural pyrethrin (Biospray S), permethrin (Biokill)  and  cypermethrin  (Ripcord)  were  suspended in the growth medium. The calculation of the  final  concentrations  (1-100 µ M)  of  natural pyrethrin, permethrin and cypermethrin was based on the concentrations of active compounds in the commercial  mixtures.  The  test  substances  were added to the wells, and the cells were grown for a further 7 days. Co-exposure to oestradiol was studied  with  0.1nM  oestradiol.  The  exposure  was stopped by adding 10% trichloroacetic acid into the wells. The plates were deep-frozen at -75°C.

## The bioluminescence assay for ATP

The  bioluminescence  method  uses  the  luciferase enzyme,  which  catalyses  the  formation  of  light from  ATP  and  luciferin  (7-9).  The  plates  were thawed, and 25 µ l of cell suspension from each well was  moved  onto  black  microplates  (ThermoLabsystems).  When  measuring  the  total  ATP, 100 µ l of a mixture (1:5) of Tris-acetate buffer and ATP-monitoring reagent was added into the wells. The  plates  were  shaken,  and  the  luminescence intensity was measured with a ThermoLabsystems Luminoskan Ascent luminometer, with an integration time of 1000ms.

## WST-1 test

The WST-1 test is a colorimetric assay for the quantification of cell proliferation and cell viability. The evaluation of cell proliferation is based on the cleavage  of  the  tetrazolium  salt,  WST-1,  by  the  mitochondrial  dehydrogenases  in  viable  cells  (10,  11). MCF7 cells were cultured and exposed to the test compounds  in  a  similar  way  to  that  used  for  the ATP measurement. After exposure for 7 days, 10 µ l of  WST-1  cell  proliferation  reagent  was  added  to 100 µ l of the medium in each well, and the plate was shaken for 1 minute. The plates were incubated for 50 minutes in a humidified atmosphere at 37°C, and the  absorbances  were  measured  at  450nm  with  a Multiskan MS (Labsystems, Vantaa, Finland).

## Statistics

The  determinations  were  repeated  five  times  at each dose level, with three tests in each determination.  The  mean  ±  SEM  of  15  independent  tests were  calculated  at  each  concentration.  Statistical differences between treated cells and controls were evaluated by using one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's post hoc test (GraphPad Prism).

## Results

In this study, MCF7 human breast carcinoma cells were  exposed  for  7  days  to  three  commercial pyrethroid  compounds  (pyrethrin,  permethrin  and

cypermethrin)  with  and  without  co-exposure  to 0.1nM oestradiol. Cypermethrin contains an alphacyano group, while pyrethrin and permethrin do not. Cell proliferation was evaluated by determining the total ATP content of the cells with a luminometric method, and cytotoxicity by determining mitochondrial metabolic activity with the WST-1 test.

In the co-exposure experiment with oestradiol (0.1nM)  and  various  concentrations  of  pyreth- roids, there was a clear increase in MCF7 cell proliferation  (Figures  1-3).  Exposure  to  0.1 µ M pyrethrin  with  0.1nM  oestradiol  increased  the total  ATP to 388%, compared to the control (no oestradiol,  no  pyrethroid  compound).  Without oestradiol, the ATP content after 0.1 µ M pyrethrin  exposure  was  127%  compared  to  the control.  Corresponding  results  for  cypermethrin were  373%  (with  oestradiol)  and  125%  (without

Compared  to  the  control  (no  oestradiol,  no pyrethroids),  oestradiol  alone  increased  the  cell proliferation to 280% in the ATP test and to 130% in the WST-1 test.

Without  oestradiol,  pyrethroids  did  not  cause any  significant  increases  in  proliferation  at  low concentrations  (Figures  1-3).  High  concentra- tions were cytotoxic, and the greatest cell toxicity was that of cypermethrin in both tests, starting at the 10 µ M concentration. Correspondingly, the cytotoxic effect started at the 50-100 µ M concentrations of pyrethrin and permethrin.

To illustrate the effects of pyrethroids on the cell proliferation  caused  by  oestradiol,  the  ATP  and WST-1 results from the co-exposure of pyrethroids and  oestradiol  were  compared  with  the  effect  of

0.1nM  oestradiol  only  (Table  1).  This  comparison showed that pyrethroids significantly increased the proliferation  of  MCF7  cells  at  low  concentrations, according to the ATP results. Pyrethrin and cypermethrin caused a significant increase in ATP content at the 0.1-1 µ M concentrations, and permethrin at the 0.1-10 µ M concentrations. In the WST-1, the corresponding  effect  was  not  seen.  For  detecting both  cell  proliferation  and  cell  toxicity,  measurement of the ATP content of the cultured MCF7 cells was more sensitive than measurement of mitochondrial enzyme activity with the WST-1 test.

## Discussion

Pyrethroids  are  the  most  common  insecticides  in use for indoor and agricultural purposes. They are considered safe because of their low accumulation and effective biodegradation. However, there is evidence of chronic and irreversible injuries caused by pyrethroid intoxication. Symptoms in humans have even appeared more than two years after intoxication (12, 13). The endocrine disruption capability of pyrethroids  has  raised  major  environmental  concern  in  the  past  few  years  (17,  18).  There  is  evi-

388                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I.  Kakko dence of the effects of pyrethroids on the regulation of thyroid hormone  and  androgen  functions. Furthermore,  pyrethroids  at  high  concentrations seem to inhibit the binding of testosterone to receptors by a competitive mechanism (17, 19-25).

We studied three chemically different pyrethroid compounds, namely, pyrethrin (natural pyrethrin) and  two  synthetic  pyrethroids  (permethrin  and cypermethrin). Pyrethrin is a mixture of active constituents in pyrethrum extracts. Cypermethrin differs  from  permethrin  and  pyrethrin  in  having  an alpha-cyano group in its molecular structure. The alpha-cyano  group  is  usually  connected  with  the toxicity  of  the  pyrethroid  in  question.  Toxicity  to the  central  and  peripheral  nervous  systems  is caused  by  alterations  in  the  permeability  of  the sodium  channels  and  subsequent  disturbances  in the transfer of nerve impulses. Pyrethroids without an alpha-cyano group generally show the weakest toxic effects (14). In our previous studies, we have found  that  cypermethrin  inhibits  the  activity  of synaptosomal  ATPases  after in  vitro exposure, more  than  pyrethroids  having  no  cyano  group  in their molecules (15, 16). In the present study with the  MCF7  cell  line,  the  most  cytotoxic  compound was cypermethrin, both in the ATP test and in the WST-1 test.

In  addition  to  specifically  neurotoxic  pyrethroid mechanisms,  various  other  cytotoxic  effects  have been detected. They can affect the regulation of the cell cycle, and, consequently, mitotic cell cycle progression  (27).  Pyrethroids  also  have  genotoxic effects  (6,  28-30).  They  can  induce  chromosomal aberrations, sister chromatid exchanges and micronuclei in human lymphocyte cell cultures (6, 28), although, in human in vivo studies, no induction  of  chromosomal  aberrations  has  been  found (31, 32). The results with various cells in vitro may vary,  due  to  differences  in  the  regulation  of  cell growth  in  individual  cell  types.  Interaction  with hormone regulation in certain cells may dominate and overcome other changes.

In  the  present  study,  all  three  pyrethroid  compounds considerably increased the proliferative effect of 0.1nM oestradiol alone, when applied at low concentrations together with oestradiol to the MCF7 cell cultures. The most effective synergists at low concentrations  were  pyrethrin  (Biospray  S)  and  cypermethrin  (Ripcord).  This  synergistic  effect  may  be  of importance, because human blood concentrations of oestradiol vary between 0.08nM and1.6nM in women and 0.03nM and 0.2nM in men. This could mean that the  normal  blood  oestradiol  concentration  may  be able to enhance the effects of pyrethroids on steroidregulated  cells.  In  earlier  studies,  pyrethroids  have been shown to have oestrogenic potential (17, 18, 26). Their  structural  components  show  similarity  to oestrogen metabolites and polyphenols, which might

In conclusion, our results show that pyrethroids have a clear effect on cell proliferation and the viability of MCF7 cell cultures. At low concentrations (&lt;  10mM),  pyrethroids  increased  the  oestradiolinduced proliferation in MCF7 cell culture detected with the ATP test. At higher concentrations, cytotoxic effects were detected.
