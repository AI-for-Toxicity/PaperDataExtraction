ABSTRACT Introduction: Many clinical studies have demonstrated that continuous exposure to pesticides, especially organophosphates and pyrethroids, causes toxicities such as carcinogenicity and neu- rotoxicity that lead to disorders such as diabetes, lung cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. The mechanism underlying pesticide-induced neurotoxicity involves the production of ROS, which causes neuronal injury through oxidative stress. Methods: In the present study, the neuronal SH- SY5Y cell line was used to investigate the effect of the pesticides chlorpyrifos (organophosphate), aldicarb (carbamate), and deltamethrin (pyrethroid) on ROS-mediated toxicity and the protective effect of alpha-2-macroglobulin (a2M), a protease inhibitor and beta-amyloid plaque scavenger in the human brain. For cell viability and cytotoxicity, the MTT assay was performed. To moni- tor ROS production, assays such as DCFHDA, H2O2, and MDA were performed, along with assays of the activity of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. Results: The experimental findings suggest a cytoprotective role for a2M in ROS-mediated toxic- ity that causes neuronal injury in humans. Conclusion: Hence, a2M could be possibly used as a protective agent against oxidative neurotoxicity caused by pesticides. Key words: Alzheimer's disease, SH-SY5Y, reactive oxygen species, neurotoxicity, deltamethrin, chlorpyrifos, aldicarb, alpha-2-macroglobulin INTRODUCTION The pesticides chlorpyrifos (CPF), aldicarb (ALD), and deltamethrin (DLM; Figure 1) are known to cause both acute and chronic neurotoxicity in humans and animals through the inhibition of cholinesterase (ChE) activity in the synaptic junction of neurons, binding to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-gated channels by preventing the closure of sodium chan- nels 1. Humans are exposed to these pesticides in a number of ways, such as the consumption of fruits and vegetables contaminated with pesticide sprays and the inhalation of fumigants 2–5. Apart from caus- ing substantial toxicity, these pesticides interfere with normal neuronal processes in vivo, leading to oxida- tive damage and cellular inflammation in the human brain 6–8. Some of the modifications caused by these pesticides include oxidative stress 9, disrupted neu- rotransmission 10 and neuronal differentiation 11, in- hibition of replication in neuronal cells 12, cognitive changes, decrease in psychomotor functions 13, and apoptosis in neuronal cells by their metabolites 14–17. Such changes in neurons may lead to various neurode- generative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and/or Parkinson’s disease (PD) 18–20. Alpha-2-macroglobulin (a2M) is produced in the hu- man brain and keeps a check on reactive oxygen species (ROS) 21 and ß-amyloid plaque formation, thereby preventing neuronal degeneration and AD progression. a2M is a serum protease inhibitor that may be involved in AD in mediating the clearance and degradation of Aß, a major constituent of ß-amyloid deposits 22,23. a2M, an acute-phase protein and a major component of the innate immune system, is a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) marker of neuronal injury in preclinical AD [22]. An increased concentration of a2M in the blood is associated with neuronal in- jury 24. Previous studies have shown that a2M in- teracts with the above mentioned pesticides 3,21, in- dicating the probable role of a2M as an unexplored biomarker in pesticide-induced ROS-mediated neu- in the present study, a2M rotoxicity 25. Hence, was used to study the modulating/impairing effect of pesticide generated ROS on the neuronal SH-SY5Y (NCCS, Pune) cell line. 26. METHODS Materials All pesticides (CPF, ALD, and DLM) and chemicals (MTT dye, DMSO, pyrogallol, DMEM and Ham’s F12 medium, fetal bovine serum [FBS], thiobarbituric acid [TBA], 1% penicillin-streptomycin, dichlorodi- hydrofluorescein diacetate [DCFH-DA], glutathione Cite this article :  Dixit S, Ahsan H, Khan F H.

All other reagents used were of analytical standard. METHODS Purification and characterization of human a2M The a2M protein was isolated and purified from hu- man blood plasma using ammonium sulfate precip- itation followed by gel exclusion chromatography as per the method described previously 3. A 5% (w/v) native PAGE was performed 21 and the gel was stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 (0.15% in 10% acetic acid). The gel was de-stained for 12 h in the de- staining solution (10% acetic acid), and the purified a2M formed a single band on the gel. Cell culture The SH-SY5Y cell line was cultured in a medium con- taining 1:1 DMEM and Ham’s F12 medium, 10% FBS, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin 26. The cells were treated with a standard solution of pesticides and a2M, accordingly, to perform the experiments. Cells were used at 3–7 passages. The cells were divided into five groups based on the treatment with pesticides and proteins to obtain results for various stress markers. Group I was the control group comprising only SH- C and 5% SY5Y cells under standard conditions ( CO2). Group II consisted of SH-SY5Y cells incubated with a2M. The concentration of protein was 2 mM and the incubation time was 3 h ( C). Group III comprised pesticide (CPF, ALD, and DLM)-treated SH-SY5Y cells. Cells were treated with 5 mM of each pesticide (CPF, ALD, and DLM) separately for 3 h un- der standard conditions ( C and 5% CO2). Group IV was the pesticides (CPF, ALD, and DLM) and a2M group, in which the SH-SY5Y cells were treated with 5 mM of the pesticides for 3 h and then treated with a2M for 3 h. ◦ ◦ ◦ Cell viability and proliferation assay To determine the cytotoxicity and cell viability of the SH-SY5Y cells, the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide MTT assay was per- formed in 96-well plates 27. The cells were used at 70– 80% confluence. Later, the medium was removed and the cells were treated with pesticides (CPF, ALD, and DLM; 5 mM) for 6 h and later incubated with a2M for 3 h. Afterward, the cells were treated with MTT solution (5 mg/mL stock solution) at a final concen- tration of 0.5 mg/mL MTT. The cells were incubated for 4 h at C in 5% CO2. Finally, the cells were treated with 100 mL DMSO for 10 min to dissolve the formazan crystals. The absorbance was measured us- ing an ELISA plate reader at 570 nm with a reference wavelength of 630 nm and was directly proportional to the number of viable cells. The experiments were performed in triplicate. ◦ Measurement of ROS ROS production was measured using DCFH-DA 28. The cells were treated with a2M and the pesticides, following which 10 mM DCFH-DA was added to the medium for 1 h at C for diffusion into the cells. A multi-detection microplate reader was used for fluo- rescence measurement. The excitation and emission wavelengths for DCFH-DA were 485 and 535 nm, re- spectively 28–30. ◦ Measurement of malonaldehyde (MDA) lev- els To detect the generation of ROS by pesticides in the neuronal cell line, the MDA levels were measured. The MDA levels in SH-SY5Y cells were quantified with the TBA reaction. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were measured by comparing the absorption to the standard curve of MDA equivalents generated by the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of tetram- ethoxypropane 31. The absorbance was recorded at 532 nm. Measurement of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity The antioxidant enzyme SOD converts superoxide (cid:0):) into H2O2 and O2, which is converted to wa- (O ter by other enzymes. The measurement was carried out as described previously 32. To 80 mL of the cell suspension, 2.82 ml of 0.05 mM tris-succinate buffer was added, and the sample was treated for 30 min in a CO2 incubator. The reaction was initiated by adding 100 mL of 8 mM pyrogallol solution to each well 32. The absorbance was read at 420 nm.

Measurement of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) levels Measurement of SOD levels and GPx activ- ity GPx are cytosolic enzymes that catalyze the conver- sion of H2O2 into H2O and O2 and the reduction of peroxide radicals (ROO.) into alcohol and oxy- gen. GPx levels were measured by determining the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm upon the oxidation of NADPH to NADP+ 33. Statistically analysis All experiments were repeated thrice and the data shown is the mean +- SD. P-value < 0.05 is considered as significant difference. RESULTS Cell viability and cell cytotoxicity assay The MTT assay was performed to assess cell viability and cell proliferation activity, in which the quantity of formazan is directly proportional to the number of viable cells. The SH-SY5Y cells treated with all three pesticides (CPF, ALD, and DLM) in group III showed reduced cell viability (p < 0.001; Figure 1). Almost no effect on viability was seen for cells treated with a2M (group II), while the effect of the pesticides appeared to be reversed in cells treated with pesticides after in- cubation with a2M (group IV). Measurement of ROS levels Figure 3 shows the ROS levels induced by the pesti- cides as monitored by DCFHDA in the control group of SH-SY5Y cells and all three pesticides in group III (p < 0.001). The increased fluorescence in group III as compared to the control group and a2M group indi- cates the production of ROS. On the contrary, group IV showed a reduction in the fluorescence intensity as compared to group III, indicating the defensive func- tion of a2M against ROS production. Measurement of MDA Figure 4 shows the TBARS activity in the SH-SY5Y cells in various groups. The highest MDA produc- tion was recorded in group III, in which the cells were treated with pesticides. However, group II showed no TBARS production. Group IV (pesticides + cells + a2M), however, showed a reduction in the TBARS level as compared to group III. The MDA levels were normal in the control group and slightly reduced in the a2M group (p < 0.001). However, MDA levels were significantly decreased in the a2M + pesticides + cells group (p < 0.001) compared to the pesticides group. Hence, the protective effects of a2M were ob- served with respect to MDA levels due to pesticide- triggered ROS in SH-SY5Y cells. Figure 5 shows the effect of various treatments on SOD levels in the control and other groups. Group III (pesticides group) showed reduced SOD activity as compared to group I (control) and group II (a2M; p < 0.001), demonstrating the toxicity triggered by the pesticides. On the other hand, group IV (a2M + pesticides + SH-SY5Y cells) showed a remarkable in- crease in SOD and GPx activity levels, indicating the protective effect of a2M against the pesticides. Ta- ble 1 shows the effect of pesticides on the activity of antioxidant enzymes in the cells. The pesticides group showed reduced GPx activity as compared to the con- trol group I and a2M group II, while group IV (a2M and pesticides) showed increased GPx activity levels. DISCUSSION CPF, ALD, and DLM are potent neurotoxic pesti- cides that affect various neuronal processes involved in the synaptic transmission and growth of neu- rons 34–37. a2M is an acute-phase protein produced in the brain to keep ROS levels under control 3,21 and prevent amyloid plaque formation by dissolving them through receptor-mediated endocytosis. It also pro- tects the brain from undergoing neuronal degenera- tion 25. a2M is also a major component of the innate immune system and acts as a hallmark of neuronal injury 21. The human brain synthesizes and secretes a2M upon stimulation with interleukin-6, which in- dicates that a2M is an acute-phase protein in the hu- man CNS. In this study, we characterized ROS formed by CPF, ALD, and DLM in the SH-SY5Y cell line. Fur- thermore, we investigated the ability of a2M to mod- ulate the neurotoxic effect of these pesticides. The cel- lular toxicity of these pesticides on SH-SY5Y cells was first measured by the MTT assay, which indicated the toxic effects of the pesticides on the cell line. DCFH-DA is a fluorimetric dye that is applied to quantify ROS 38. This non-fluorescent compound dif- fuses into the cells, where it is sequentially hydrolyzed to release DCFH as the substrate by intracellular en- zymes. ROS oxidize DCFH and convert it into DCF, a fluorescence product that is measured by spectroflu- orometry using a microplate reader. A significant in- crease in the production of DCF was seen in pesticide- treated cells. This increased production of ROS results in oxidative damage to cellular components. How- ever, when a2M was incubated with pesticide-treated cells, a contrary effect was observed. Similarly, re- garding MDA levels, pesticide-treated groups showed a significant increase in absorbance, but in group IV, a Figure 2: MTT assay of various groups of SH-SY5Y cells and all three pesticides (CPF, ALD, and DLM). Cells were pretreated with pesticides at 5 mM for 3 h and then incubated with a2M for 3 h. After incubation, cell via- bility was evaluated by the MTT assay. The results are shown as the mean (cid:6) SEM of three experiments, with each experiment performed in triplicate (p < 0.001 versus control). Group II is not statistically significant to Groups I, III and IV. Figure 3: DCFHDA ROS assay of SH-SY5Y cells. ROS were determined by the DCFH-DA method. DCFH-DA measurements are reported as fluorescence intensities (AU, arbitrary fluorescence units). Results are mean (cid:6) stan- dard error of triplicates. The error bar depicts the standard error among the six different samples of that group. Cells were incubated with 5 mM of each pesticide for 45 min, and the a2M concentration was 2 mM. Excitation and emission wavelengths for DCFH-DA were 485 and 535 nm, respectively. Group II is not statistically significant to Groups I, III and IV.

SOD and GPx measurements are reported in mmol/min/mg cells for SOD and nmol/min/mg cells for GPx (SOD, superoxide dismutase; GPx, glutathione peroxi- dase). decrease in absorbance was observed, suggesting the potential effect of a2M on pesticide-treated cells, in contradiction with results obtained for group IV. Re- garding antioxidant enzymes, SOD and GPx activi- ties were quantified at 420 nm and 340 nm, respec- tively, and reported as units per milligram of cells for SOD and nanomoles per minute per milligram of cells for GPx 39. The results obtained for groups III, IV, and V suggest a cytoprotective role for a2M against ROS-mediated toxicity induced by the pesticides. Be- cause proteases and ROS work through a common mechanism of inflammation, like in diseases such as atherosclerosis 40, these findings also indicate the pro- tective role of a2M in preventing damage to various cellular species by ROS apart from trapping proteases. totoxic effect of these pesticides. Hence, this study showed that a2M modulates pesticide-induced ROS- based neurotoxicity based on different parameters. Thus, a2M could possibly be used as a protective agent against neurotoxicity caused by ROS and pes- ticides, warranting further experimental studies.
