Chlorpyrifos and Cypermethrin Induce Apoptosis in Human Neuroblastoma Cell Line SH-SY5Y Grzegorz Raszewski1, Marta Kinga Lemieszek2, Krzysztof Łukawski1, Małgorzata Juszczak2 and Wojciech Rzeski2, 1Department of Physiopathology, Institute of Rural Health, Lublin, Poland, 2Department of Medical Biology, Institute of Rural Health, Lublin, Poland and 3Department of Virology and Immunology, Institute of Microbiology and Biotechnology, Maria Curie-Sklodowska University, Lublin, Poland (Received 24 March 2014; Accepted 3 June 2014) Abstract: Our previous in vivo studies showed that chlorpyrifos (CPF) and cypermethrin (CM) in a mixture dermally adminis- tered, strongly inhibited cholinesterase activity in plasma and the brain and were very toxic to the rat central nervous system. In this work, the mechanisms of neurotoxicity have not been elucidated. We used human undifferentiated SH-SY5Y cells to study mechanisms of pesticide-induced neuronal cell death. It was found that chlorpyrifos (CPF) and its mixture with cypermethrin (CPF+CM) induced cell death of SH-SY5Y cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, as shown by MTT assays. Pesticide- induced SH-SY5Y cell death was characterized by concentration-dependent down-regulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL as well as an increase in the caspase 3 activation. Pan-caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPh produced a slight but significant reversal effect of pesti- cide-induced toxicity indicating that the major caspase pathways are not integral to CPF- and CPF+CM-induced cell death. Fur- thermore, signal transduction inhibitors PD98059, SL-327, SB202190, SP600125 and mecamylamine failed to attenuate pesticides effect. Atropine exhibited minimal ability to reverse toxicity. Finally, it was shown that inhibition of TNF-a by poma- lidomide attenuated CPF-/CPF+CM-induced apoptosis. Overall, our data suggest that FAS/TNF signalling pathways may partici- pate in CPF and CPF+CM toxicity. The toxic responses of pesticides on cellular and molecular level can be studied in cultured cells using standard methods. Most of the pesticides do not produce the same pattern of toxic responses because of the involvement of different toxico- logical mechanisms and different lines of cultured cells used in studies. The SH-SY5Y cell line has been widely used in experi- mental neurological studies, including analysis of neuronal differentiation, metabolism and function related to neurodegen- erative and neuroadaptive processes, neurotoxicity and neuro- protection [1]. Consequently, this cell line is a reliable model for studying the neurotoxic effect of pesticides and for eluci- induced neurotoxicity from the dating the mechanisms of aspect of apoptosis [1]. Insecticides that are currently available on the market show very good efficiency in pest fighting, a low environmental cumulation and quite low toxicity to human beings. Actually, the most popular classes of insecticides are synthetic pyreth- roids and organophosphates. In this study, we focused on two insecticides representing these groups, used as single com- pounds or as a mixture of both chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin. in The application of pesticides decreased toxicity of mixture components, additive or syner- gistic toxicity. Although the effects of individual pesticides on health have been studied for decades, the neurotoxicity of mixtures is still poorly understood. in mixture may result Author for correspondence: Grzegorz Raszewski, Department of Physio- pathology, Institute of Rural Health, 20-950 Lublin, Jaczewskiego 2, Poland (fax: + 48 81 747 86 46, e-mail raszewski.grzegorz@yahoo.pl). Chlorpyrifos (CPF), O,O-diethyl O-3,5,6-trichloropyridin-2- yl phosphorothioate, an organophosphorus insecticide, is one of the most extensively used insecticides [2]. Chlorpyrifos is known to induce acute and chronic neuro- toxicity in people and animals primarily by inhibiting cholin- esterase activity [3]. Besides causing in vivo toxicity by AChE inhibition, CPF may also induce other activities within exposed cells. Consequently, recent research has focused on identifying chlorpyrifos toxicity independent of its effect on AChE inhibition. The in vitro and in vivo studies showed that CPF at low concentrations induced oxidative stress [4], dis- turbed neurotransmission [5], inhibited replication in cells of the nervous system [6], disrupted neuronal differentiation [7] and induced neurobehavioural changes (e.g. weakness of psy- chomotor function, reduction of Mental Development Index (MDI) scores in children) [2]. Moreover, CPF and its metabo- lite chlorpyrifos oxon (CPO) were able to induce apoptosis in several types of cells [8,9] including neuronal cells [10,11]. Cypermethrin (CM) [(RS)-a-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl(1RS)- cis-trans-3-(2,2-dichloro-vinyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarb- oxylate] is a synthetic pyrethroid used as an insecticide in large-scale commercial agricultural applications as well as in consumer products for domestic purposes. CM is considered as the most safest pesticide used worldwide [12], but evidence has shown that CM could induce various toxic effects includ- ing developmental neurotoxicity [12,13], oxidative stress [14] and apoptosis [13]. The potential developmental neurotoxicity of CM has also been investigated in vitro using neuronal cell lines, including human neuronal cell SH-SY5Y [15]. The neu- rotoxic responses of cypermethrin are mainly mediated by the

APOPTOSIS IN CHLORPYRIFOS AND CYPERMETHRIN INTOXICATION modulation of ion channels, including sodium and chloride channels. As one of the primary targets for cypermethrin is insect voltage-gated sodium channel (VGCC), it is expected that mammalian sodium channels and receptors regulated by it can also act as primary targets for toxicity in human beings. Other main channels and receptors, which are influenced by cypermethrin, calcium channels (VGCC), potassium channels, GABA receptors, glutamate receptors, acetylcholine receptors and ATPases [16]. voltage-gated include It has been demonstrated that many of the toxic effects elic- ited by exposure to pesticides are mediated by the regulation of apoptosis and redox (reduction/oxidation) signalling [10]. Pesticides have been shown to induce apoptosis by activating a wide variety of signalling pathways mediated by mitochon- dria, DNA damage (intrinsic pathways) as well as by activation/modulation of death receptors (extrinsic pathways) [17]. The extrinsic pathway is activated by the ligation of death receptors. Death receptor ligands characteristically initi- ate signalling via receptor oligomerization, which in turn results in the recruitment of specialized adaptor proteins and activation of caspase cascade causing the apoptotic cells death [18]. The mammalian family of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are serine-threonine kinases that mediate intracellu- lar signalling associated with a variety of cellular activities including cell proliferation, differentiation, survival and death. These signalling pathways have been implicated also in the regulation of neuronal apoptosis [19]. The mammalian MAPK family consists of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2, p38 MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MEK1,2) and the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK). JNK and p38 are preferentially activated by cell stress-inducing sig- nals, such as oxidative stress, environmental stress and toxic chemical insults [19]. The current studies were designed to assess the cytotoxicity of chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin, alone and in combination, as well as to investigate the molecular mechanism of pesti- cide-induced cell death in the SH-SY5Y cell line.

Then, 10 lL of MTT dye was added, and the cells were incubated for a further 4 hr at 37°C. Then, 100 lL of SDS buffer, pH 7.4 (10% SDS in 0.01 N HCl), was added and mixed thoroughly with the cells. The absorbance was measured at 570/620 nm using microplate reader (BioTek ELx800, Highland Park, Winooski, VT, USA). Apoptosis of cells was measured using the Cell Death Detection ELISAplus kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH) that quantifies histone-asso- ciated DNA fragments (mono and oligonucleosomes). SH-SY5Y cells (2 9 105 cells/mL) were exposed to various con- centrations of the investigated compounds: CPF (17.5, 25, 30 lM), CM (1.75, 2.5, 3 lM) or CPF+CM (17.5+1.75, 25+2.5, 30+3.0 lM) at 37°C for 24 hr. The procedure was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, the culture supernatants and lysate of cells were prepared and incubated in the microtitre plate coated with antihistone antibody. After colour development, the results were analy- sed spectrophotometrically using a microplate reader (ELx800) at 450 nm wavelength. Inhibitory studies were conducted by incubating SH-SY5Y cells (2 9 105 cells/mL) with 25 lM CPF or with CPF+CM (25+2.5 lM) in the presence and absence of 5 lM Q-VD-OPh (pan-caspase inhibi- tor), 20 lM PD98059 (ERK inhibitor), SL-327 (MEK inhibitor), SB202190 (p38 MAPK inhibitor), SP600125 (JNK inhibitor), 25 lM atropine (muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist), 25 lM meca- mylamine (nicotinic cholinergic receptor antagonist), 1 lM pomalido- mide (TNF-a inhibitor) and 1 lg/mL SAB4700005 (anti-CD95, clone Dx-2 antibody), 2 lg/mL anti-CD95 (CD95/Apo-1 clone Dx2) anti- body and 1 lg/mL SAB4502989 (anti-TNF-R2 antibody). After 24 hr of incubation in standard conditions, apoptosis was determined with the Cell Death Detection ELISAplus kit, as described above. Reagents working solutions. Chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin stock solutions (100 mM) were prepared in ethanol and stored at 4°C. Working solutions were prepared by dissolving an appropriate stock solution in culture medium. In each case, CM in mixture with CPF Western blot analysis. SH-SY5Y cells were seeded on 6-well microplates at 2.5 9 105 cells/mL density. On the following day, the culture medium was removed and cells were exposed to 25 lM CPF alone or to a mixture of CPF and CM in a proportion of 25:2.5 lM GRZEGORZ RASZEWSKI ET AL. (v/v), in the fresh medium supplemented with 15% FBS. SH-SY5Y cells were exposed to tested compounds for the time intervals of 1– 24 hr (1, 3, 6, 24 hr). After treatment, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, harvested and lysed in RIPA buffer 1% NP40 (Tergitol), 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM Na3VO4, 20 mM NaF, 0.5 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, protease inhibitors mixture in PBS, pH 7.4 and centri- fuged at 14 000 9 g for 10 min. Protein content in supernatants was determined by BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Rock- ford, IL, USA). RIPA cells lysates were solubilized in sample buffer (30% glycerol, 10% SDS, 0.5 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.012% bromophe- nol blue, 5% b-mercaptoethanol) and boiled for 5 min. Equal amounts of proteins were electrophoresed on 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane. After blocking for 1 hr at room temperature with 5% non-fat dry milk in TBS-0.1% Tween-20 (TBS-T), membranes were probed at 4°C overnight with primary antibodies directed against b-actin, caspase-3, cleaved caspase-3, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (Cell Signal- ling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA), followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cell Signalling Technology) for 1 hr at room temperature and visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce Biotechnology). Serial exposures were made on Kodak BioMax Light film (Eastman Kodak Company, Rochester, NY, USA). For stripping, membranes were incu- bated with stripping buffer, ReBlot Plus Strong Antibody Stripping Solution (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), then washed, blocked and probed with the relevant antibody, as described above. The amount of protein was densitometrically determined using Image J software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA). Statistical analysis. The data were presented as the mean value and standard error of the mean (S.E.M.). Statistical analysis was performed with the one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test (GraphPad Prism 5, GraphPad Software, Inc, San Diego, California, USA). Significance was accepted at p < 0.05. The IC50 value was calculated using computerized linear regression analysis of quantal log dose-probit functions, according to the method of Litchfield and Wilcoxon [21]. Results Pesticide-induced cell death in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. To examine the toxic effects of CPF and CM, SH-SY5Y cells were treated with varying concentrations of CPF (5–500 lM) or CM (0.5–50 lM) and assayed for cell viability at various times after treatment using the MTT metabolism assay. CPF reduced MTT metabolism in a concentration- and time-dependent man- ner (fig. 1), suggesting that CPF decreases neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells viability. In contrast, CM at concentrations from 0.5 to 25 lM used in these conditions had no effect on MTT metabolism whereas at the concentration of 50 lM reduced it (p < 0.05) (results not shown). To determine the effect of CM on cytotoxicity of CPF in SH- SY5Y cells, we compared the effects of CPF in a mixture with CM (at a concentration of 1/10 CPF) with the effects of CPF alone. As shown in fig. 1, the MTT metabolism after 24, 48 and 72 hr exposure with the mixture of CPF+CM was significantly reduced compared with that observed in the presence of CPF alone, indicating that CM had an additional effect on the cyto- toxic effect of CPF on SH-SY5Y cells. The IC50 values at 24, 48 and 72 hr for CPF and CPF+CM were 313, 182, 51 lM (for CPF) and 103, 66, 44 lM (for CPF+CM), respectively. A B C Fig. 1.

Panel A represents the toxic effect of pesticides at 24 hr, Panel B at 48 hr and Panel C at 72 hr. Data are representative of at three independent experiments.

To further confirm the effects of pesticides on the induction of apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells, fragmentation of DNA (a hall- mark of apoptosis) was examined by Cell Death Detection ELISAplus kit. As shown in fig. 2, CPF-induced apoptosis of SH-SY5Y cells in a concentration-dependent manner.

APOPTOSIS IN CHLORPYRIFOS AND CYPERMETHRIN INTOXICATION presence and absence of several specific inhibitors of these signalling pathways: PD98059 (ERK inhibitor), SL-327 (MEK inhibitor), SB202190 (p38 MAPK inhibitor) and SP (JNK inhibitor), for 24 hr. As shown in fig. 5, none of the signal transduction inhibitors reversed pesticide-induced apop- tosis as determined by DNA fragmentation. As SH-SY5Y cells possess functional cholinergic system consisting of cholinergic receptors and cholinesterase [22], a possible role of this system activation during CPF- and CPF+CM-induced toxicity was examined. Thus, SH-SY5Y cells were exposed to CPF and CPF+CM in the presence of either atropine (muscarinic receptor antagonist) or mecamyl- amine (nicotinic receptor antagonist). As presented in fig. 6, atropine administration effectively reduced pro-apoptotic prop- erties of tested pesticides. On the contrary, mecamylamine was not able to attenuate pesticide-induced apoptosis. There- fore, our data suggest that stimulation of muscarinic receptors may contribute to CPF- and CPF+CM-induced toxicity in SH- SY5Y cells. As TNF-a is pro-apoptotic mediator [23], we decided to determine whether its activation mediated pesticide-induced apoptosis. CPF- and CPF+CM-treated cells were exposed to pomalidomide, a pharmacological inhibitor of TNF receptor. The treatment with 25 lg/mL pomalidomide caused statisti- cally significant reduction in both CPF- and CPF+CM-induced apoptosis (fig. 7). (TNF) Apoptosis is induced by a subgroup of the tumour necrosis factor receptor superfamily. These so-called death receptors include CD95 (Fas/APO-1), DR3, TNF-R1 and two TRAIL receptors. To further analyse whether tested com- pounds could be related to modulation of CD95 receptor, we examined the expression of CD95 receptor in cells subjected to CPF and CPF+CM. If the CD95 pathway is involved in pesticide-induced apoptosis, the effective activation of this pathway using an anti-CD95 antibody should enhance the drug-induced death. The co-incubation of SH-SY5Y cells with anti-CD95 antibody significantly increased apoptosis induced by CPF and CPF+CM in these cells, as shown in fig. 8A. On the contrary, to see whether blockage of CD95 receptor could mediate increased resistance to pesticide-induced apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells, we used SAB4700005, anti-CD95 (clone LT95) antibodies. The antibody LT95 does not induce CD95- mediated apoptosis. As shown in fig. 8B, treatment of SH- SY5Y cells with SAB4700005 prior to addition of CPF and CPF+CM did not reduce pesticide-induced apoptotic cell death. These results indicate that CD95 receptors may be involved in apoptosis caused by tested compounds. Cellular response to TNF-a is mediated through interaction with receptors TNF-R1 and TNF-R2 and results in activation of pathways that favour both cell survival and apoptosis depending on the cell type and biological context [23]. As there is substantial evidence showing that TNF-a can promote neuronal cell survival through TNFR2 receptor [23], we exam- ined the ability of anti-TNF-R2 antibody to inhibit apoptosis of SH-SY5Y cells induced by tested pesticides. As shown in fig. 9, treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with SAB4502989 and anti-TNF-R2 antibody, prior to addition of Fig. 2. Chlorpyrifos (CPF), cypermethrin (CM) or mixture of chlor- pyrifos and cypermethrin (CPF+CM) induces apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells. SH-SY5Y cells were incubated with various concentrations of CPF and CPF+CM for 24 hr. The Cell Death Detection ELISA kit was used to quantify DNA fragmentation cells undergoing apoptosis.

Statistically significant changes were noted after cell treatment with CPF at concentration 25 lM and its mixture with 2.5 lM CM (p < 0.001). The increase in DNA fragmentation in SH- SY5Y cells was observed during the use of the mixture of pes- ticides as compared to the use of CPF alone, but there were no statistically significant differences. This study also found that CM, at the concentrations of 1.75, 2.5 and 3 lM, does not induce apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells (fig. 2). Mechanism of pesticide-induced apoptosis in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. In this study, the concentration of CPF (25 lM) and its mix- ture with 2.5 lM CM was chosen based on the minimum con- centrations of pesticides that caused a significant apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells. To investigate the mechanism by which CPF and CPF+CM induced apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells, we examined the influ- ence of tested compounds on the expression of proteins involved in cell death. We performed Western blot analysis to detect the activation of caspase-3, caspase-3-cleaved, Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 in pesticide-treated cells. Activation of caspases was evident within 1 and 3 hr of CPF and CPF+CM treatment (fig. 3A–B). Above-mentioned changes correlated with expres- sion of antiapoptotic proteins: Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 (fig. 3C–D). The decrease in their expression was observed in the men- tioned period of time. This study also found that Q-VD-OPh, a pan-caspase inhibi- tor, significantly inhibited pesticide-induced apoptosis in SH- SY5Y cells (fig. 4). These findings suggest that CPF and CPF+CM induced apoptosis, at least partially, via the caspase- 3 pathway. To determine whether various MAP kinase signalling path- ways are involved in the regulation of pesticide-induced apop- tosis, SH-SY5Y cells were exposed to pesticides in the GRZEGORZ RASZEWSKI ET AL.

Fur- thermore, it was extended to investigate the ability of cyper- methrin (CM), used at a fixed concentration of 1 out of 10 of the concentration of CPF, to modulate the neurotoxic effect of this organophosphate compound. Cypermethrin at this concen- tration is often used in a mixture with chlorpyrifos as insecti- cides for plant protection. The cellular toxicity of the pesticides on SH-SY5Y cells was assessed by the MTT metabolism assay. Our data showed that CPF and its mixture with CM (CPF+CM) induced cyto- toxicity in concentration- and time-dependent manners (fig. 1). In contrast, CM (except for the concentration of 50 lM) had no effect on MTT metabolism in SH-SY5Y cells. Chlorpyrifos induced toxicity at concentrations as low as 25 lM. The mixture of CPF+CM caused significantly higher cytotoxicity than that caused by CPF, indicating that CM had an additional cytotoxic effect on SH-SY5Y cells (fig. 1). Also, the IC50 values for the mixture of pesticides were about three times lower than for CPF. Chlorpyrifos is used as a model pesticide to investigate the role of pesticide exposure in the induction of neuronal cell death. Similarly, a recent study showed that CPF significantly reduced cell viability and cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells in a concentration-dependent manner [10]. Additionally, Caughlan et al. [11] reported that CPF caused a dose-dependent reduc- tion in viability of rat cortical neurons and CPF was cytotoxic to dopaminergic neuronal cell line, PC-12 [24]. The cytotoxic effect of CM (the preparation ripcord con- tained an active compound cypermethrin) on SH-SY5Y cells was examined previously by Kokko et al. [25]. In this work, exposure to 0.1–100 lM of CM showed dose-dependent Fig. 4.

The detectable toxicity of CM started at 1 lM concentration and at a concentration of 15 lM the cell viabil- ity (WST-1) was about 72% of control, while at 25 lM decreased to 15% of control. Our results showed much lower cytotoxicity of CM on SH- SY5Y cells. CM used in concentrations from 0.5 to 25 lM had no effect on cell viability (MTT) in studied cells. The effect of cytotoxiciy of CM appeared at the concentration of 50 lM. Differences in the cytotoxicity of CM on SH-SY5Y cells may be due to the application of a pyrethroid with different degrees of purity. In a cited work [25], Ripcord was used, which contained an active compound CM and a mixture of xylene and petrol 820 g/L. It should be noted that xylene and petrol may be also toxic to SH-SY5Y cells and when used with CM, the toxic effects of these all substances could be additive. The toxicity of complex chemical mixtures may differ from the toxicity observed when individual components are tested as pure chemicals. Previously, our in vivo studies showed that CPF and CM in a mixture dermally administered, strongly inhibited cholinesterase activity in plasma and brain and were very toxic against rat central nervous system [26]. In the cur- rent study, we observed that CM at concentration starting from 2.5 lM had significantly synergistic effect on CPF-induced cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells, as determined by MTT assays (fig. 1). The results clearly indicate that the mixture of CPF and CM is more toxic to the SH-SY5Y cells than CPF used alone. This finding could be important because in common use for plant protection are insecticides containing CPF and CM in propor- tions used in this study, for example Nurella 500EC, CYMAX or Spine, from which aqueous emulsions containing pesticides at micromolar concentrations are prepared. Chlorpyrifos and its mixture with CM apparently triggered cell death by apoptosis, as indicated by the characteristic frag- mentation of genomic DNA, one of the hallmarks of apopto- sis. The observed effect was concentration-dependent, and SH- SY5Y cells were similarly sensitive to combination of CPF+CM or CPF used alone (fig. 2). It is noteworthy that the concentration of 1.75, 2.5 and 3 lM does not CM at induce apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells (fig. 2). So, the study of the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis was analysed using CPF and its mixture with CM. These observations are consistent with the data of other authors and support earlier findings which indicated that CPF induces neurotoxicity through apoptotic mechanisms [11,24]. Because of that and to confirm pro-apoptotic features of their influence on caspases 3, Bcl-2 and tested pesticides, GRZEGORZ RASZEWSKI ET AL. caspase 3, which indicates its activation and the beginning of the changes leading to cell death. The addition of caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPh significantly attenuated pesticide-induced apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells (fig. 4), confirming the impor- tance of this pathway in terms of assessed process. Notwith- standing, Q-VD-OPh use did not lead to a complete inhibition of initiation-programmed cell death by tested compounds, sug- gesting that other pathways are also involved. Besides the activation of caspases 3, simultaneously, Wes- tern blot analysis has shown a decrease in mitochondrial sur- vival proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. The observed changes may suggest that tested compounds disrupted mitochondrial func- tion (intrinsic pathways), the consequence of which is apopto- sis. Similarly, Park et al. [10] demonstrated that CPF induced apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells by the activation of caspase- and nuclear condensation, and another study showed that CFP-induced apoptosis in dopaminergic neuronal components of PC12 cells is partially mediated by the activation of this caspase [24]. Further, it has been shown that major caspase pathways are integral to pesticide-induced apoptosis [27]. As activation of MAPKs, including ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, MEK 1/2 and JNK, has been implicated in the activity of neu- rotoxins, SH-SY5Y cells were exposed to CPF and CPF+CM in the presence and absence of MAPKs inhibitors [4,11,28].

After 24 hr, 25 lM CPF and its mix- ture with 2.5 lM CM were slightly toxic to SH-SY5Y cells, while the addition of SP 600125 (JNK inhibitor) significantly enhanced DNA fragmentation in SH-SY5Y cells. SB (p38 MAPK inhibitor), PD 980059 (ERK inhibitor) and SL- 327 (MEK inhibitor) did not cause this effect (fig. 5). It should be noted that SP600125 and SL-327 are also toxic to SH-SY5Y cells and thus enhanced toxicity exhibited in the presence of pesticide may constitute an additive effect. On the other hand, we have not examined the expression of MAPKs in SH-SY5Y cells. Fig. 7.

Caspase-3 is a critical executor of apoptosis being responsible for the proteolytic cleavage of many key proteins, which dam- age initiates the cell death programme [17]. CPF and CPF+CM were shown to increase the expression of cleaved In other studies, CPF treatment (100 lM, for 24 hr) acti- vated MAPK pathways, including ERK 1/2, the JNK, and the p38 MAP kinase and MAPK inhibitors (10 lM U0126, 5 lM SP600125 or 5 lM SB203580, respectively), and inhibited CPF-induced apoptosis in the dopaminergic cell line SH- SY5Y [4] and PC-12 [24]. In these studies, all the MAPK inhibitors affected cell survival by reducing ROS generation and caspase activation, suggesting that JNK, ERK1/2 and p MAPK activation occurs upstream of caspase-3 activation and that oxidative stress activates these signalling molecules [4,24]. In other in vitro models, Saulsbury et al. [29] reported that CPF-induced apoptosis was not related to MAPK signal- ling pathways in placental cells except p38 MAPK when pes- ticide was applied at a concentration of 60 lM, at 12 hr. transduction inhibitors tested However, none of the signal attenuated the toxic effects of CPF at 24 hr [29]. Furthermore, Caughlan et al. [11] demonstrated that CPF (60 lM, at 12 hr) activated ERK1/2, p38 and JNK signalling pathways in rat cortical neurons. This apoptosis was attenuated by SL-327, an

APOPTOSIS IN CHLORPYRIFOS AND CYPERMETHRIN INTOXICATION A B Fig. 8. The effects of anti-CD95 antibodies on chlorpyrifos (CPF) or mixture of chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin (CPF+CM)-induced SH-SY5Y cell apoptosis SH-SY5Y cells were pre-incubated in the presence and absence of 2 lg/mL anti-CD95 and clone Dx2 antibodies or 1 lg/mL SAB4700005, anti-CD95 and clone LT95 antibodies, for 1 hr before treatment with CPF or CPF+CM for 24 hr. Panel A represents anti-CD95 and clone Dx2 antibodies which may induce CD95-mediated apoptosis. Panel B represents SAB4700005, anti-CD95 and clone LT95, which does not induce CD95-mediated apoptosis. The Cell Death Detection ELISA kit was used to quantify DNA fragmentation cells undergoing apoptosis. Data are representative of three independent experiments.

Moreover, some MAPK inhibitors had different effects on cell survival [30]. Here, we report also that the CD95 (Fas/Apo1)-receptor was activated by tested compounds and mediated apoptosis in neu- roblastoma cells via DNA fragmentation. Pre-incubation of SH-SY5Y cells with anti-CD95 antibody in combination with pesticides resulted in an increase of apop- tosis in SH-SY5Y cells. As the activation of the CD95 (Fas/ Apo1)-receptor produced augmentation of the toxic effects of pesticide tested, remains a possibility that CPF and CPF+CM induced neurotoxicity via CD95-mediated apoptotic cell death. These observations have been supported by the fact that inhibition of CD95 receptor by SAB4700005 did not reduce pesticide-triggered apoptosis. it In the present study, we demonstrated for the first time that pomalidomide (TNF-a inhibitor) attenuated the pesticide- induced apoptosis via reducing the DNA fragmentation in SH- SY5Y cells. These data indicate that the TNF-a receptors con- tribute to the induction of SH-SY5Y cells apoptosis after insecticide treatment and participate in the pro-apoptotic path- ways to mediate pesticide-induced apoptosis. The mechanism of the protective effect of inhibition of TNF-a can be mediated by TNF-a signalling via the TNF-a type 1 receptor (TNF-R1, p55TNFR) and TNF-a type 2 recep- inhibition of tor (TNF-R2, p75TNFR). We also noted that TNF signalling through TNFR2 induced by SAB caused inhibition of CPF- and CPF + CM-induced toxicity. Overall, our data suggest that TNF-a may participate in CPF and CPF+CM toxicity and corroborate earlier findings stating that TNF-a levels are increased in animals exposed to CPF [31]. Pomalidomide is the newest immunomodulatory drug and was created by a chemical modification of thalidomide. Its Fig. 9.

Considering our findings, as well as studies of a number of authors who investigated the toxic effects of CPF on other cells, this result is quite predictable. CPF activated ERK1/2, p38 and JNK signalling pathways in the dopaminergic cell line (PC-13, SH-SY5Y) at concentrations (100 lM) much higher than in the present study (25 lM). In other experimen- tal models, the lower concentration of CPF (60 lM) was not GRZEGORZ RASZEWSKI ET AL. mechanism of action is incompletely understood but involves anti-angiogenic effects and immunomodulation [32]. Apart from the immunomodulatory effects showed by pomalido- mide on the inhibition of TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6 and IL-12 and the enhancement of IL-10 production, pomalidomide may have other unknown anti-inflammatory effects [33]. Direct cytotoxic effects have been shown by pomalidomide, includ- ing the inhibition of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF- jB) and apoptosis induction via the caspase 8/death receptor pathway [34]. Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF- a) has been shown to trigger many signalling pathways. It is known that TNF-a sig- nalling is mediated via two distinct receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2, which showed partially overlapping signalling mecha- nisms and biological roles depending on cell type [35]. Con- trary to the cytotoxic effects of TNF-a through TNFR1, there is substantial evidence showing that TNF-a can promote neural cell survival through another TNF-a receptor, TNFR via the activation of NFjB [34]. As shown by Saulsbury et al. [29], chlorpyrifos-induced toxicity was characterized by the loss of mitochondrial potential, the appearance of nuclear condensation and fragmentation, down-regulation of Bcl-2 as well as up-regulation of TNF-a and FAS mRNA. However, in inhibition of FAS and TNF-a this study, pharmacological receptors did not attenuate CPF-induced toxicity in placental cells [29]. In conclusion, the current study provides insights concern- ing the molecular mechanisms of pesticide-induced apoptosis in neuronal cells. Both CPF and its mixture with CM were found to induce neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells via apoptotic pathways. The obtained results may have implications for pes- ticide exposure in human beings, especially agricultural work- ers. Consequently, the exposure to investigated pesticides should be reduced.
