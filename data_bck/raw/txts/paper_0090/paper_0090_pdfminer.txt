ABSTRACT We previously demonstrated that acute inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) is a common mode of action for (sub)micromolar concentrations of chemicals, including insecticides. However, because human exposure to chemicals is usually chronic and repeated, we investigated if selected insecticides from different chemical classes (organochlorines, organophosphates, pyrethroids, carbamates, and neonicotinoids) also disturb calcium homeostasis after subchronic (24 h) exposure and after a subsequent (repeated) acute exposure. Effects on calcium homeostasis were investigated with single- cell ﬂuorescence (Fura-2) imaging of PC12 cells. Cells were depolarized with high-Kþ saline to study effects of subchronic or repeated exposure on VGCC-mediated Ca2þ inﬂux. The results demonstrate that except for carbaryl and imidacloprid, all selected insecticides inhibited depolarization (Kþ)-evoked Ca2þ inﬂux after subchronic exposure (IC50’s: approximately 1–10 mM) in PC12 cells. These inhibitory effects were not or only slowly reversible. Moreover, repeated exposure augmented the inhibition of the Kþ-evoked increase in intracellular calcium concentration induced by subchronic exposure to cypermethrin, chlorpyrifos, chlorpyrifos-oxon, and endosulfan (IC50’s: approximately 0.1–4 mM). In rat primary cortical cultures, acute and repeated chlorpyrifos exposure also augmented inhibition of VGCCs compared with subchronic exposure. In conclusion, compared with subchronic exposure, repeated exposure increases the potency of insecticides to inhibit VGCCs. However, the potency of insecticides to inhibit VGCCs upon repeated exposure was comparable with the inhibition previously observed following acute exposure, with the exception of chlorpyrifos. The data suggest that an acute exposure paradigm is sufﬁcient for screening chemicals for effects on VGCCs and that PC12 cells are a sensitive model for detection of effects on VGCCs.

Insecticides are com- monly classified according to their structure and best-known neurotoxic mode of action. Organochlorine insecticides are gen- erally banned but very persistent and still present in the envi- ronment (Mrema et al., 2013). Organochlorines are subclassified in 2 main groups: 1,1,1-Trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT)-type insecticides that target voltage-gated sodium chan- nels (VGSCs) and chlorinated alicyclic insecticides that target c-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine receptors (Coats, 1990). Pyrethroid insecticides delay the inactivation of VGSCs and thus increase the Naþ influx, which consequently depolarizes the cell membrane resulting in overexcitation (Soderlund, 2012). Organophosphate insecticides are best known for their irrevers- ible inhibition of acetylcholine esterase (AChE), which results in increased levels of ACh and subsequent overexcitation (Eaton et al., 2008). Bioactivation of organophosphates via the formation of oxon metabolites strongly increases their neurotoxic potency via AChE inhibition (Eaton et al., 2008). Carbamate insecticides also inhibit AChE, but these insecticides inhibit AChE activity reversibly and do not require bioactivation (Moser et al., 2010). Neonicotinoid insecticides exert neurotoxic overexcitation via ac- tivation of nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs; Matsuda et al., 2009). Traditional in vivo tests for the investigation of neurotoxicity of such insecticides and other chemicals are expensive, labori- ous, may not be sufficiently sensitive and often lack informa- tion on mechanisms of toxicity (Coecke et al., 2006). Therefore, there is an increasing interest for the development of in vitro screening methods to test chemicals for (developmental) neuro- toxicity. Voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) are likely a suitable target for in vitro neurotoxicity screening as—together with calcium permeable neurotransmitter receptors, intracellu- lar calcium stores, and calcium-binding proteins—VGCCs tightly control the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2þ]i; Westerink, 2006). This strict control of [Ca2þ]i is essential for a range of cellular processes including proper neuronal function (Simms and Zamponi, 2014; Westerink, 2006), development (Leclerc et al., 2011), and survival (Zu¨ ndorf and Reiser, 2011). PC12 cells are well characterized neuronotypical cells that are known to express L-, N-, and P/Q-type VGCCs (Dingemans et al., 2009). PC12 cells are therefore a suitable cell model for mechanistic neurophysiological and neurotoxicological (screen- ing) studies related to these channels (Westerink, 2013; Westerink and Ewing, 2008). The effects of acute in vitro expo- sure to pesticides on VGCCs in PC12 cells are already well-stud- ied, and it is known that acute inhibition of VGCCs is a common mode of action of organochlorine, pyrethroid, and organophos- phate insecticides (Heusinkveld and Westerink, 2012; Meijer et al., 2014a, 2014b) and conazole fungicides (Heusinkveld et al., 2013). Moreover, several other types of chemicals have been demonstrated to acutely inhibit VGCCs, such as brominated and halogen-free flame retardants (Dingemans et al., 2009, 2010; Hendriks (PCBs; Langeveld et al., 2012), and drugs of abuse (Hondebrink et al., 2011, 2012). et al., 2014), polychlorinated biphenyls It is, however, largely unclear if these effects of insecticides on VGCCs persist and if subchronic or repeated exposure to in- secticides increases the potency of insecticides for inhibition of VGCCs. Subchronic and/or repeated exposures are more realis- tic exposure scenarios because exposure to insecticides usually occurs chronically and repeatedly via occupational (eg, agricul- ture) settings or consumption of food. Therefore, this study in- vestigated the effects of subchronic (24 h) and repeated (24 h pre-exposure followed by a second, acute exposure) exposure to endosulfan, cypermethrin, chlorpyrifos, chlorpyrifos-oxon, car- baryl, and imidacloprid on calcium homeostasis in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS Chemicals. Fura-2 AM was obtained from Molecular Probes (Invitrogen, Breda, The Netherlands). Chlorpyrifos-oxon (purity 93.5%) was obtained from AccuStandard (New Haven). Cypermethrin (purity 95.1%), chlorpyrifos (purity 99.9%), endo- sulfan (a:b 2:1; purity 99.9%), imidacloprid (purity 99.9%), car- baryl (purity 99.5%), and all other chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands) unless otherwise noted. Saline solutions (containing in mM: 125 NaCl, 5.5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 0.8 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 24 glucose, and 36.5 sucrose at pH 7.3, adjusted with NaOH) were prepared with deionized water (Milli-Q; resistivity > 18 MX(cid:2)cm). Stock solutions were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and final solutions (solvent con- centration 0.1% DMSO) were prepared just prior to the experiments. Cell culture. Rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells (Greene and Tischler, 1976) were cultured for up to 10 passages in RPMI (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine (ICN Biomedicals, Zoetermeer, The Netherlands) as described previ- ously (Meijer et al., 2014a,b). Medium was refreshed every 2– days. 2% penicillin/streptomycin serum, and Rat primary cortical cells were isolated from brain cortices of newborn (PND1) rats (Wistar; HsdCpb:WU; Harlan Laboratories B.V., Horst, The Netherlands). Briefly, rats were decapitated, and brains were rapidly dissected in phosphate buffered saline on ice. Tissue was dissociated to single cells by use of a cell strainer (diameter 100 mM) and suspended in Neurobasal-A medium sup- plemented with 25 g/l sucrose, 450 mM glutamine, 30 mM gluta- mate, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% FBS (pH 7.4). A droplet of approximately 400 ml cell suspension was added to mm glass-bottom dishes (to obtain a cell density of 400 cells/dish), and cells were allowed to adhere for approximately 3 h prior to the addition of extra medium to obtain a total of 2. ml medium/dish. After day 1 in culture, medium was replaced with comparable medium, but with 2% B27 instead of FBS. After day 4 in culture, the medium was replaced with Neurobasal-A medium supplemented with 25 g/l sucrose, 450 mM glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% FBS (glutamate-free medium). All cell culture material was coated with poly-L-lysine (50 mg/ml). Cells were cultured in a humidified incubator at 37(cid:3)C and 5% CO2. For cell viability experiments, PC12 cells were seeded in 48- wells plates (0.3 (cid:4) 106 cells/well) and allowed to attach over- night. Cells were exposed to 0.1% DMSO (vehicle control) or insecticide (0.1–100 mM) in phenol red- and serum-free RPMI medium for 24 h. (MatTek, Ashland, Massachusetts) For single-cell fluorescent microscopy Ca2þ imaging experi- ments, undifferentiated PC12 cells were subcultured in glass- bottom dishes at approximately 0.5 (cid:4) 106 cells/dish (approximately 75% conflu- ency) and were allowed to attach for at least 2.5 h. Rat primary cortical cells were cultured in glass-bottom dishes for 7–11 days. Then, medium of PC12 cells was replaced with serum-free RPMI1640 medium, and medium of primary cortical cells was replaced for 50% with glutamate-free medium that contained 0.1% DMSO (vehicle control) or insecticides (1 nM to 10 mM). l D o w n o a d e d f r o m h t t p s : / / i a c a d e m c . o u p . c o m / t o x s c i / l / / I I / / a r t i c e

MEIJER ET AL. | Cell viability (alamar Blue and CFDA-AM). Cell viability was quanti- fied with a combined alamar Blue (aB)/CFDA-AM assay as described previously (Heusinkveld et al., 2013) with minor modi- fications. The aB assay determines mitochondrial activity as a measure of cell viability based on the ability of the cells to reduce resazurin to resorufin. In the same experiment, mem- brane integrity was assessed by CFDA-AM, which is cleaved by nonspecific esterases in living cells to the fluorescent com- pound CFDA. After 24 h exposure to the different pesticides (0.1–100 mM), aB/CFDA-AM was added to the wells to obtain a final concentration of 12 and 4 mM aB and CFDA-AM, respec- tively. Then, cells were incubated in the dark with the aB/CFDA- AM solution for 30 min at 37(cid:3)C. Fluorescence was measured with an Infinite M200 microplate reader (10 W Xenon flash light source; Tecan Trading AG, Ma¨ nnedorf, Switzerland) at excita- tion wavelength 540 nm, emission 590 nm (aB) and excitation wavelength 493 nm, emission 541 nm (CFDA). [Ca21]i measurements. Changes in [Ca2þ]i were measured with the Ca2þ-sensitive fluorescent ratio dye Fura-2 AM. PC12 cells, 24 h pre-exposed to insecticides, were loaded with 5 mM Fura-2 AM for 20 min in saline, followed by 15 min de-esterification of Fura-2 AM in saline at room temperature. Cells were placed on the stage of an Axiovert 35 M inverted microscope ((cid:4)40 oil-immersion objective, NA 1.0: Zeiss, Go¨ ttingen, Germany) equipped with a TILL Photonics Polychrome IV (Xenon Short Arc lamp, 150 W; TILL Photonics GmBH, Gra¨ felfing, Germany) and continuously superfused with saline by use of a Valvelink 8.2 (Automate Scientific, California). Fluorescence, excited by 340 and 380 nm wavelengths (F340 and F380), was collected every 3–6 s at 510 nm with an Image SensiCam digital camera (TILL Photonics GmBH). All experi- ments were performed at room temperature. Every experiment consisted of a 5-min baseline recording and a subsequent depo- larization of the cells by superfusion with saline containing mM Kþ (containing in mM: 5.5 NaCl, 100 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 0.8 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 24 glucose, and 36.5 sucrose at pH 7.3, adjusted with NaOH) for 24 s. Then, superfusion was reset to saline for approximately 28 min prior to a second depolarization with mM Kþ-containing saline (see Fig. 1A). In a separate set of experiments (for repeated exposure), superfusion was changed 8 min after the first depolarization to saline containing insecti- cides for 20 min (acute exposure). Following this 20 min repeated acute exposure, cells were depolarized for a second time with Kþ- and insecticide-containing saline (see Fig. 1B). At the end of each recording, cells were permeabilized with 5 mM ionomycin to determine the maximum ratio (Rmax), after which all Ca2þ was chelated with 17 mM ethylenediamine FIG. 1. Example traces of control experiments. PC12 cells were pre-exposed to insecticides (or vehicle control, 0.1% DMSO) for 24 h as indicated by the dashed box before the example recordings. Then, insecticide containing saline was removed to load cells with Fura-2 AM for the recording of [Ca2þ]i. In the case of subchronic experi- ments, cells were not exposed during the [Ca2þ]i recording and during depolarization as indicated by the empty box below the example recording (A). To investigate the effects of a repeated exposure, cells were exposed for a second time for 20 min before a second depolarization (Kþ2) was induced as indicated by the dashed box below the example recording (B). During the recording of [Ca2þ]i, cells were depolarized with high Kþ-containing saline after approximately 5 min (Kþ1) and 33 min (Kþ2). To quantify effects on basal [Ca2þ]i after subchronic exposure the average basal [Ca2þ]i of 3–5 min of the recording was used (indicated by a in Fig. 1A). To calcu- late effects on basal [Ca2þ]i for repeated exposure approximately 13.3–18.3 min was used (indicated by d in Fig. 1B). Effects on the depolarization-evoked increase in [Ca2þ]i were expressed as a net increase in [Ca2þ]i as indicated by b (for subchronic exposure; A) and c (for repeated exposure; B). l D o w n o a d e d f r o m h t t p s : / / i a c a d e m c . o u p . c o m / t o x s c i / l / / I / I / a r t i c e

Data analysis and statistics. Cell viability data were analyzed by use of MS-Excel. Raw data were background-corrected and nor- malized to plate-matched DMSO controls. At least 3 independ- ent experiments (N) were performed to obtain at least 12 wells (n) per condition. Data are expressed as mean 6 SEM of n wells. Cell viability data were compared by use of an one-way ANOVA and a post hoc Bonferroni test. Data were considered statistically significant if p < .05. equation Calcium-imaging data were processed with TILLVisION soft- ware (version 4.01) and further analyzed with a custom-made MS-Excel macro that calculates background-corrected F340/F ratio values and [Ca2þ]i. To calculate free cytosolic [Ca2þ]i from background-corrected F340/F380 ratio values, we used a modified [Ca2þ]i ¼ Kd* (cid:4) (R (cid:5) Rmin)/(Rmax (cid:5) R), Grynkiewicz’s where Kd* is the dissociation constant of Fura-2 determined in the experimental setup (Meijer et al., 2014a,b). Insecticide-induced effects on basal [Ca2þ]i after repea- ted exposure were expressed as the average increase in [Ca2þ]i (6 SEM from n cells) during the first 5 min of re-exposure of responding cells (Fig. 1B). Responding cells are cells that dis- played an increase in [Ca2þ]i during exposure (cid:6) average þ SD of basal [Ca2þ]i. Effects on the depolarization-evoked increase in [Ca2þ]i were expressed as a net increase (see Fig. 1 for illustra- tion). Data were expressed as mean 6 SEM (from n cells), nor- malized to the control, unless otherwise noted. The data were expressed in n, rather than N (independent experiments), to enable the study of single-cell calcium kinetics and oscillations. Moreover, the variation within an independent experiment (within a dish [n]; CV of control repeated exposure: 0.44) was larger compared with the variation between the experiments (between dishes [N]; CV of control repeated exposure: 0.17), which indicates that cells are independent units derived from the same population and justifies the use of n as statistical unit. Cells that showed effects over 2 times SD above or below aver- age were considered as outliers and were excluded for further analysis (approximately 13%). Per test condition at least 4 inde- pendent experiments (N) were performed to obtain (cid:6) 25 cells (n) after outlier exclusion. For the calculation of concentrations that induces an inhibitory effect of 20% or 50% (IC20 or IC50), a non-linear regression curve with Hill-slope was fitted by use of GraphPad Prism software (version 6, GraphPad Software, La Jolla, California). Continuous data were compared with an unpaired t test. Data were considered statistically significant if p < .05. RESULTS Cytotoxicity Concentration-Effect Range Finding: Effects of Subchronic (24 h) Exposure to Insecticides on Cell Viability in PC12 Cells Carbaryl, imidacloprid, endosulfan, chlorpyrifos, and cyper- methrin did not significantly affect mitochondrial activity in PC12 cells at concentrations 0.1–100 mM after 24 h of exposure as indicated by the aB assay (data not shown). Only chlorpyrifos- oxon was able to significantly reduce the mitochondrial activity to 67 6 5% of control at the highest concentration tested (100 mM; n ¼ 12, N ¼ 3; data not shown). Similarly, membrane integrity was not significantly affected by imidacloprid, endo- sulfan, and chlorpyrifos as indicated by the CFDA assay in PC cells (Fig. 2). Carbaryl modestly reduced membrane integrity to 88 6 2% of control at 100 mM (n ¼ 12, N ¼ 3). At 100 mM, membrane integrity compared with control was also reduced by chlorpyri- fos-oxon (58 6 5%; n ¼ 12, N ¼ 3) and cypermethrin (54 6 3%; n ¼ 16, N ¼ 4; Fig. 2). Because cell viability is only affected by some insecticides at 100 mM, the maximum concentration in subsequent experiments was kept (cid:7) 10 mM. Effects of 24 h of Subchronic Exposure to Insecticides on Basal [Ca21]i and Depolarization-Evoked Increase in [Ca21]i in PC12 Cells In control (0.1% DMSO) PC12 cells, basal [Ca2þ]i was low and sta- ble (106 6 2 nM; n ¼ 212, N ¼ 15; Fig. 1A). Basal [Ca2þ]i following largely subchronic unchanged (ranging from 95 6 5 nM [10 mM cypermethrin; n ¼ 65, N ¼ 4] to 131 6 5 nM [10 mM endosulfan; n ¼ 59, N ¼ 5]; Fig. 3). to insecticides was exposure (24 h) The effects of 24 h subchronic exposure to insecticides on Ca2þ influx via VGCCs were investigated by depolarization of the cell membrane 5 min after the start of the recording (for illustration see b in Fig. 1A). In control cells (24 h subchronic exposure to 0.1% DMSO), depolarization induced a net increase FIG. 2. Cell viability following 24 h of exposure to insecticides from different chemical classes. Effects on membrane integrity were investigated with a CFDA-AM assay to study the effects of insecticides on cell viability. Data, presented as mean þ SEM of n ¼ 12–16 obtained from N ¼ 3–4, was normalized to DMSO control (%).

Carbaryl ((cid:7) 10 mM) was not able to significantly reduce the depolariza- tion-evoked increase in [Ca2þ]i (89 6 6% at 1 mM [n ¼ 57, N ¼ 4] and 92 6 6% at 10 mM [n ¼ 61, N ¼ 6] compared with control; Fig. 3). Similarly, imidacloprid did not affect the depolarization- evoked increase in [Ca2þ]i (96 6 5% at 10 mM; n ¼ 58, N ¼ 4; Fig. 3). In contrast, if depolarization was induced in cells subchroni- cally exposed to 10 mM endosulfan, the net increase in [Ca2þ]i amounted only to 1.0 6 0.08 mM, which is 46 6 4% compared with control (n ¼ 59, N ¼ 5; Figs. 3 and 4A). At 1 mM, endosulfan did not significantly affect the depolarization-evoked increase in [Ca2þ]i (107 6 7% compared with control; n ¼ 69, N ¼ 4; Fig. 4A). Chlorpyrifos did not significantly affect the depolarization- evoked increase in [Ca2þ]i at 0.1 mM (96 6 6%; n ¼ 57, N ¼ 4; Fig. 4B). However, at 1 mM, chlorpyrifos significantly reduced the net increase in [Ca2þ]i to 78 6 6% of control (n ¼ 59, N ¼ 4; Fig. 4B), and to 55 6 4% of control at 10 mM (n ¼ 59, N ¼ 5; Figs. 3 and 4B). For chlorpyrifos-oxon, no significant reduction in the depolari- zation-evoked increase in [Ca2þ]i was observed at 0.01 mM (92 6 5% compared with control; n ¼ 54, N ¼ 5; Fig. 4C). At 0.1 mM, chlorpyrifos-oxon significantly reduced the depolarization- evoked increase in [Ca2þ]i to 74 6 4% (n ¼ 61, N ¼ 5; Fig. 4C), 62 6 6% (n ¼ 62, N ¼ 5; Fig. 4C) at 1 mM and 55 6 3% at 10 mM (n ¼ 64, N ¼ 6; Figs. 3 and 4C) compared with control. Cypermethrin did not significantly affect the depolarization- evoked increase in [Ca2þ]i at 0.1 mM (101 6 6% compared with control; n ¼ 64, N ¼ 5; Fig. 4D), but reduced the depolarization- evoked increase in [Ca2þ]i significantly at 1 mM to 45 6 4% (n ¼ 70, N ¼ 5; Fig. 4D) and at 10 mM to 1 6 0.2% compared with control (n ¼ 65, N ¼ 4; Figs. 3 and 4D). for a second time. To investigate if the inhibition of the depolarization-evoked increase in [Ca2þ]i by insecticides is reversible, cells were depolarized approximately 28 min after the first depolarization- evoked increase in [Ca2þ]i In control experiments, this second depolarization-evoked increase in [Ca2þ]i amounted to 1.9 6 0.07 mM (n ¼ 212, N ¼ 15; Fig. 1A; Table 1). At 10 mM endosulfan, the second depolarization-evoked increase in [Ca2þ]i amounted to 0.9 6 0.07 mM (n ¼ 59, N ¼ 5; Fig. 3; Table 1), which was 46 6 4% compared with control (Table 1). This second depolarization-evoked increase in [Ca2þ]i was com- parable with the first depolarization-evoked increase in [Ca2þ]i, which was also 46 6 4% compared with control (Table 1). At 10 mM cypermethrin, both the first and the second depolariza- tion-evoked increases in [Ca2þ]i were completely inhibited (Fig. 3; Table 1). Chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos-oxon also demon- strated comparable net increases in [Ca2þ]i during the first and second induced depolarization (Table 1). Carbaryl and imidaclo- prid were not able to change the second depolarization-evoked increase in [Ca2þ]i compared with control and these insecticides thus also demonstrated comparable net increases in [Ca2þ]i dur- ing the first and second depolarization (Fig. 3; Table 1). Effects of Repeated Exposure (24 h Pre-exposure Followed by an Acute Exposure) to Insecticides on Basal [Ca21]i and Depolarization- Evoked Increase in [Ca21]i in PC12 Cells To investigate the effects of repeated exposure to insecticides, cells pre-exposed to insecticides for 24 h were re-exposed acutely for 20 min starting 8 min after the first depolarization- evoked increase in [Ca2þ]i (see Fig. 1B for illustration). No changes in basal [Ca2þ]i were observed with the exception of 10 mM endosulfan, which induced an increase in basal [Ca2þ]i of 71 6 13 nm in responding cells (41%; 25 of 61 cells; Fig. 3). The first depolarization-evoked increase in [Ca2þ]i in repeated exposure experiments was, as expected, comparable with the 24 h subchronically exposed cells (Fig. 3). In control cells (0.1% DMSO), the first net depolarization-evoked increase in [Ca2þ]i amounted to 2.0 6 0.05 mM and the second depolariza- tion-evoked increase in [Ca2þ]i amounted to 1.4 6 0.04 mM (n ¼ 293, N ¼ 23; Fig. 1B). Carbaryl induced a small but significant inhibition of the depolarization-evoked increase in [Ca2þ]i after repeated exposure at 10 mM (87 6 6% compared with control; n ¼ 62, N ¼ 5; Fig. 3). When cells were exposed repeatedly to 10 mM imidacloprid, no significant change in the depolarization- evoked increase was observed (105 6 6% compared with control; n ¼ 65, N ¼ 5; Fig. 3). In contrast, repeated exposure to endosul- fan concentration-dependently inhibited the depolarization- evoked increase in [Ca2þ]i at 0.1 mM (65 6 6%; n ¼ 71, N ¼ 5; Fig. 4E) and resulted in a nearly complete inhibition at 10 mM (2 6 0.3%; n ¼ 61, N ¼ 6; Figs. 3 and 4E). Chlorpyrifos also concen- depolarization-evoked tration dependently increase in [Ca2þ]i at 0.1 mM (66 6 5%; n ¼ 65, N ¼ 5; Fig. 4F) and induced a nearly complete inhibition at 10 mM (3 6 0.4%; n ¼ 61, N ¼ 5; Figs. 3 and 4F). Chlorpyrifos-oxon induced a significant inhibition at 0.1 mM (83 6 3%; n ¼ 62, N ¼ 5; Fig. 4G) and inhibited the depolarization-evoked increase to 38 6 3% of control at 10 mM (n ¼ 62, N ¼ 6; Figs. 3 and 4G). Cypermethrin inhibited the depolarization-evoked concentration dependently at 1 nM (86 6 6%; n ¼ 83, N ¼ 5; Fig. 4H) and inhibited the depolarization-evoked increase to 5 6 0.6% at 10 mM (n ¼ 74, N ¼ 5; Figs. 3 and 4H). in [Ca2þ]i increase reduced the Effects of Exposure to Insecticides on Basal [Ca21]i and Depolarization-Evoked Increase in [Ca21]i in Rat Primary Cortical Cells In control rat primary cortical cells, basal [Ca2þ]i was low and stable following acute exposure to 0.1% DMSO (113 6 3 nM; n ¼ 101, N ¼ 17; data not shown). Acute exposure to 10 mM chlor- pyrifos induced an increase in basal [Ca2þ]i of 107 6 15 nM in responding cells (90%; 41 of 45 cells; data not shown). Interestingly, upon exposure of cells to endosulfan or cyper- methrin, continuous oscillations in basal [Ca2þ]i were observed (Fig. 5). No changes in basal [Ca2þ]i were observed for 10 mM chlorpyrifos-oxon upon acute exposure (data not shown). Due to the observed continuous oscillations upon exposure to endosulfan or cypermethrin, inhibition of VGCCs could not be accurately determined as the oscillations could influence the sensitivity to the Kþ-induced depolarization and hampers reli- able quantification of the inhibitory effects. Therefore, effects on the depolarization-evoked increase in [Ca2þ]i were only qualified for chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos oxon. Upon depolarization of control (0.1% DMSO) primary cells with high Kþ-containing saline, [Ca2þ]i increased rapidly and transiently to 1.5 6 0.08 mM (n ¼ 101, N ¼ 17; data not shown). Following 20 min of exposure to 0.1% DMSO, the depolarization- evoked increase in [Ca2þ]i amounted to 1.0 6 0.05 mM (n ¼ 101, N ¼ 17; data not shown). Following acute exposure to chlorpyri- fos, the depolarization-evoked increase in [Ca2þ]i amounted to 116 6 7% of control at 0.1 mM (n ¼ 40, N ¼ 6), and was significantly reduced to 62 6 4% of control at 1 mM (n ¼ 56, N ¼ 5) and to 81 6 7% of control at 10 mM (n ¼ 45, N ¼ 7; Fig. 6). Upon acute exposure to chlorpyrifos-oxon, the depolarization-evoked increase in [Ca2þ]i amounted to 90 6 8% of control at 0.1 mM (n ¼ 25, N ¼ 4), and was significantly reduced to 44 6 5% of con- trol at 1 mM (n ¼ 47, N ¼ 6) and to 67 6 7% of control at 10 mM (n ¼ 43, N ¼ 4; data not shown). To compare the effects of acute, subchronic and repeated exposure scenarios in PC12 cells with effects in primary cortical cells, primary cortical cells were also subchronically and l D o w n o a d e d f r o m h t t p s : / / i a c a d e m c . o u p . c o m / t o x s c i / l / / I / / I a r t i c e

Also, studies have previously shown that prolonged insecticide exposure may change the potency of insecticides for neurotoxicity (eg, Cao et al., 2014; Slotkin and Seidler, 2008). This study demonstrates that the potency of most insecticides for inhibition of VGCCs is comparable for acute and repeated exposure and also that the potency of insecticides for inhibition of VGCCs is lower in sub- chronic exposure conditions. In addition, the inhibition of VGCCs appeared not or slowly reversible. The observation of not or slowly reversible inhibition of VGCCs in subchronic exposure conditions suggests that a single subchronic (24 h) exposure could have prolonged consequences for VGCCs function. Prolonged effects of insecticides on neuro- toxicological targets have been reported before in vitro, eg, a decrease in GABAA receptor function by long-term (6 days) diel- drin exposure (Babot et al., 2007). Also, in vivo studies indicated that subacute and repeated exposure to chlorpyrifos could result in persistent effects on neurotoxicological endpoints, eg, neurobiochemistry and neurobehavior were permanently changed by chlorpyrifos in animals (eg, Chakraborti et al., 1993, Moser et al., 2005). We therefore hypothesized that the not or slowly reversible inhibition of VGCCs could affect the response upon subsequent repeated exposure, in particular for persistent and bioaccumulative chemicals like endosulfan. Our experi- ments demonstrate that repeated exposure indeed augmented the insecticide-induced inhibition of VGCC. However, our experiments with repeated exposure conditions also reveal that cypermethrin, chlorpyrifos-oxon, and endosulfan are basically equipotent in inhibiting VGCCs in a repeated exposure condi- tion compared with acute exposure (Table 2). Inhibitory concen- trations of insecticides that induced a 20% or 50% inhibition (IC20 and IC50 respectively) in acute and repeated exposure con- ditions were generally in the same order of magnitude. The exception to this is chlorpyrifos, which was clearly more potent in the repeated exposure scenario compared with the acute exposure condition in PC12 cells (Table 2). Nevertheless, the results suggest that the difference in potency of insecticides for inhibition of VGCCs between the 2 exposure conditions was generally limited and that the effects induced by a preceding subchronic exposure hardly influence the degree of inhibition of VGCCs by a repeated, acute exposure. The observed higher potency for chlorpyrifos after repeated exposure compared with acute exposure in PC12 cells are likely the result of adaptive mechanisms. As described, studies on subacute and repeated exposure to chlorpyrifos have shown FIG. 5. Representative recordings of [Ca2þ]i from individual primary cortical cells exposed acute to endosulfan (10 mM) or cypermethrin (1 mM). Primary cortical cells were exposed for 20 min (acute) to endosulfan or cypermethrin as indi- cated by the dashed line in the recordings. Cells were depolarized at 5 and 33.3 min as indicated by Kþ1 and Kþ2. repeatedly exposed to chlorpyrifos. In control primary cortical cells, basal [Ca2þ]i was low and stable following subchronic and repeated exposure to 0.1% DMSO (107 6 4 nM, n ¼ 82, N ¼ 7; 125 6 3 nM, n ¼ 58, N ¼ 5, respectively; data not shown). In con- trol cells subchronically exposed to 0.1% DMSO, depolarization- evoked increase in [Ca2þ]i amounted to 0.8 6 0.05 mM (n ¼ 82, N ¼ 7; data not shown). In control repeated exposure experi- ments, depolarization-evoked increase in [Ca2þ]i after the sec- ond exposure amounted to 0.7 6 0.04 mM (n ¼ 58, N ¼ 5; data not shown). The depolarization-evoked increase in [Ca2þ]i after sub- chronic exposure to chlorpyrifos was largely unchanged (89 6 9% at 1 mM; n ¼ 43, N ¼ 6; and 104 6 10% at 10 mM; n ¼ 46, N ¼ 4; Fig. 6). However, following a second, repeated exposure, chlorpyrifos did reduce the depolarization-evoked increase in [Ca2þ]i significantly to 74 6 6% at 1 mM (n ¼ 46, N ¼ 5) and to 61 6 3% at 10 mM (n ¼ 41, N ¼ 5; Fig. 6).

This suggests that adaptive mech- anisms, such as gene expression, protein function, phosphory- lation, or ubiquitination of VGCCs and/or changes in VGCCs turnover (Lipscombe et al., 2013), may play a role in the avail- functionality, and/or binding affinity of VGCCs. ability, However, it remains to be determined which adaptive mecha- nisms are involved and why particularly for chlorpyrifos an increased inhibition of VGCCs was observed after repeated exposure compared to acute exposure. Previously, we have compared the effective concentrations of the presumed primary modes of action of organophosphates, organochlorines, and pyrethroids with effective concentrations for acute inhibition of VGCCs by chlorpyrifos, endosulfan, and cypermethrin (Meijer et al., 2014b). This comparison suggested that effective concentrations for acute inhibition of VGCCs by insecticides were lower compared with effective concentrations of the presumed primary modes of action, with the exception of chlorpyrifos-oxon (Meijer et al., 2014a,b). In case of repeated exposure, effective concentrations for inhibition of VGCCs by insecticides are thus also lower compared with the effective concentrations of the presumed primary modes of action of insecticides, with the exception of chlorpyrifos-oxon (Table 2). In case of subchronic exposure, effective concentrations of chlorpyrifos, chlorpyrifos-oxon, and endosulfan were compara- ble or higher compared with the effective concentrations of the primary modes of action (Table 2). Although inhibition of VGCCs thus appears a sensitive endpoints, it must however be noted that for the different studies different experimental mod- els were used. These different models may differ in sensitivity due to the expression of different ion channels and/or receptors and presence/absence of potential feedback mechanisms (eg, Xenopus oocytes). Also, different exposure scenarios were used l D o w n o a d e d f r o m h t t p s : / / i a c a d e m c . o u p . c o m / t o x s c i / l / / I / / I a r t i c e

616 | TOXICOLOGICAL SCIENCES, 2015, Vol. 147, No. in these experimental models that, in combination with the dif- ferent properties of the model, may have influenced the effec- tive concentrations. Notably, earlier studies on VGCCs demonstrated that beside a variety of insecticides (organophosphates, organochlorines, pyrethroids: Heusinkveld and Westerink, 2012; Hildebrand et al., 2004; Liu et al., 1994; Meijer et al., 2014a,b; Neal et al., 2010; Yan et al., 2011), fungicides (Heusinkveld et al., 2013), PCBs (Langeveld et al., 2012), and brominated and halogen-free flame retardants (Dingemans et al., 2009, 2010; Hendriks et al., 2014) and other neurotoxicants can acutely inhibit VGCCs. Because VGCCs are essential for the regulation of calcium signaling, which is crucial for proper neuronal cell function (Simms and Zamponi, 2014; Westerink, 2006), development (Leclerc et al., 2011), and survival (Zu¨ ndorf and Reiser, 2011), the investigation of chemical-induced inhibition of VGCCs can be useful for screening chemicals for neurotoxicity. Obviously, chemicals that specifically affect postsynaptic targets, such as the imida- cloprid-induced modulation of nAChRs (Matsuda et al., 2009), may remain undetected. Consequently, a neurotoxicity screen- ing battery should consist of a range of endpoints to include additional neurotoxicological targets. For this study, PC12 cells were used because they express L-, N-, and P/Q-type VGCCs (Dingemans et al., 2009). The observed complete inhibition of VGCCs by insecticides thus indicates that the insecticides inhibit all VGCCs types present in PC12 cells. Calcium channels in PC12 cells are comparable with neurons, and PC12 cells are therefore a suitable model for screening for effects on VGCCs as a measure of neurotoxicity (Westerink, 2013). Also, we show that primary rat cortical cells are a less sensitive cell model for the investigation of effects specifically on VGCC inhibition. Primary rat cortical cells constitute a phys- iologically relevant model and these heterogeneous cultures form spontaneously active neuronal networks. However, effects on VGCCs can be thus obscured due to interaction with addi- tional targets. Many chemicals have additional targets, such as VGSCs in case of cypermethrin and GABA receptors in case of endosulfan, which may cause, eg, continues oscillations in basal [Ca2þ]i that could interfere with the depolarization-evoked increase in [Ca2þ]i,. For chlorpyrifos exposure, no continues oscillations in primary cortical cells were observed and effects of chlorpyrifos on VGCCs could be determined. These data show that chlorpyrifos induces a comparable rank order potency for the different exposure scenarios in PC12 cells and primary corti- cal cells. However, the level of inhibition in cortical cells was lower compared with the inhibition observed in PC12 cells. This may be due to the use of serum in the medium of primary corti- cal cells, potentially decreasing the free insecticide concentra- tions, but may also be explained by interactions between different types of neurons that express different ion channels and receptors. Taken together, the current data indicate that primary cortical neurons may not be sufficiently sensitive to reliably detect effects on VGCCs by insecticides. However, for the measurement of, eg, electrical activity, spontaneously active primary cultures, such as primary cortical neurons, are pre- ferred. Therefore, for each endpoint, the most appropriate cell model should be selected and consequently, within a battery of screening methods for neurotoxicity various cell types and lines should be used (Coecke et al., 2007; Westerink, 2013). In conclusion, our data (together with other studies) demon- strate that VGCCs are an important target for screening insecti- cides (and other chemicals) for neurotoxicity. Inhibition of VGCCs could be part of a battery of functional in vitro neurotox- icity tests. Furthermore, our data indicate that investigation of effects of acute exposure to chemicals is generally sufficient to detect insecticide (or chemical)-induced inhibition of VGCCs. However, some differences in potency of insecticides for inhibi- tion of VGCCs were observed between the exposure scenarios, which argues for the inclusion of repeated exposure conditions for specific studies.
