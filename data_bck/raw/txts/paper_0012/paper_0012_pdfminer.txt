Polish J. of Environ. Stud. Vol. 16, No. 3 (2007), 403- Original Research The Influence of Selected Pyrethroid on the Growth  and Number of ρ-Mutants in Saccharomyces  Cerevisiae Yeast A. Krzepiłko*, A. Święciło institute of Agricultural sciences in zamość, university of Agriculture in lublin,   szczebrzeska 102, 22-400 zamość, Poland Received: April 10, Accepted: January 4, Abstract The  main  purpose  of  this  study  was  to  examine  the  influence  of  pyrethroids,  such  as  deltamethrin,  cypermethrin  and  bifenthrin  on  the  growth  and  the  number  of  ρ-mutants  in  the  cells  of  Saccharomyces  cerevisiae yeast. sP-4 mat alpha leu1 arg4 yeast strain was used as a standard strain for experiments. The  cells were grown on a standard YPG liquid medium, under aerobic conditions until they reached the loga- rithmic or stationary phase of growth. Different concentrations of pyrethroid were added to the medium  and the cells were incubated for 2 h. The survival rate of the cells was determined by diluting the cells and  plating them on yPg Agar plates. The number of ρ-mutants was determined by examining the number of  cells that hadn’t grown on yPg medium from among all surviving cells. As far as the investigated forms  of pyrethroids are concerned, deltamethrin was the most toxic to yeast cells. it was also observed that low  amounts of pyrethroid caused a greater destruction of cells at the logarithmic than at the stationary stage  of growth. The influence of pyrethroid on the frequency of mutation of mitochondrial DNA of yeast cells  was also studied. it was observed that after incubation with pyrethroid addition the frequency of ρ-mutation  increased, especially at the logarithmic stage of growth. Keywords: yeast, pyrethroid, ρ-mutant. Introduction Pyrethroids are esters of primary or secondary alco- hols  containing  at  least  one  double  bond  and  chrysan- themic  acid  (2.2-dimethyl-3-(2-methylpropenyl)-cyclo- propanecarboxylic  acid),  or  halogen  analogues  of  this  acid. These pesticides are neurotoxins which inhibit the  transfer of nerve impulses by blocking nicotinic acetylo- choline receptors and receptors for gamma-aminobutyr- ic acid in the nerve cell membranes of insects [1]. such  compounds as deltamethrin, cypermethrin and bifenthrin *corresponding author; e-mail: akrzepilko@inr.edu.pl are commonly used in agriculture, veterinary medicine  and households, as they do not accumulate in the envi- ronment and are not very toxic to mammals and birds.  These  compounds  are  also  quickly  metabolized  and  eliminated  from  the  bodies  of  mammals  [2].  however,  the widespread use of pyrethroids raises concerns about  their non-specific effects on the environment and on hu- man beings. exposure to pesticides increases the risk of  neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease  in humans [3]. The non-specific effect of pyrethroids on  cells  may  concern  various  metabolic  processes.  It  has  been determined that deltamethrin induces oxidant stress  in the kidneys and liver of the Channa punctatus fish [4]  and in the organs of rats [5-7]. Krzepiłko A., Święciło A. studies on the mutagenic influence of pyrethroids have  been conducted on various plants, bacteria, insects, mam- mals and human cell lines. It should be emphasized that most  of these experiments concerned the effect of pyrethroids on  the nuclear genome. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast  is a recognized model in studies on the toxicity of various  chemical compounds which affect mitochondrial DNA [8].  These compounds cause a ρ-mutation which manifests it- self by the inability of the cells to grow on non-fermentable  carbon sources [9]. ρ-mutants are characterized by the de- letion of mitochondrial DNA (mDNA) and no mitochon- drial protein synthesis takes place in their mitochondria. ρ- mutants are also called petites, because they form smaller  colonies  than  the  wild  yeast  strain  growth  on  the  media  containing a limited amount of glucose. ρ-mutants grown  on this medium are characterized by small colonies and a  whitish  color,  whereas  non-mutant  cells  (ρ+)  form  large,  beige-colored colonies. The spontaneous frequency of this  mutation is rather high; about 2% of the yeast cell popula- tion  consists  of  ρ-mutants. The  loss  of  ability  to  perform  oxidative phosphorylation by yeast cells is not lethal, con- trary to the cells of higher eukaryotes [8]. studying mito- chondrial DNA mutation in higher eukaryotes is costly, and  using S. cerevisiae yeast makes it possible to determine the  sensitivity of mDNA to xenobiotics relatively easily. The  subject of this study was the influence of pyrethroids such  as deltamethrin, cypermethrin and bifenthrin on the surviv- al rate on the cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast and  the frequency of ρ-mutation in their mitochondrial DNA at  the logarithmic and stationary stages of culture growth. extract, 1% pepton and 2% glucose. 2% agar was added to  the solid YPG medium. The pyrethroids were purchased at the organic Indus- try Institute in Poland: bifenthrin  –  (2-methyl-1.1-biphenyl-3-y1)-methyl-3-(2- chloro-3.3.3-trifluoro-1-propenyl)-2.2-dimethyl  cyclo- propane-carboxylate, deltamethrin  –  (s)-alpha-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl  (1r)- cis-3-(2.2-dibromovinyl)-2.2-dimethylcyclopropane-car- boxylate, cypermethrin – (r,s)-alpha-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl(1rs)- cis,trans-3-(2.2-dichlorovinyl)-2.2-dimethylcyclopropane- carboxylate. In  the  logarithmic  or  stationary  stages  of  growth  the  yeast cultures were incubated for two hours with additions  of various concentrations of pyrethroids and their survival  rate  was  determined  by  observing  the  ability  of  the  cells  to form colonies on a solid YPG medium. Results of our  experiments have shown that a change in conditions, e.g. a  two–hour incubation of the cells in a buffered solution may  bring  about  a  stress  reaction  in  yeast  cells;  consequently,  pyrethroids were added directly to the yeast culture. The number of ρ-mutants was determined by plating a  suspension with a known number of yeast cells onto solid  media  with  the  addition  of  ethanol  or  glucose  and  then  comparing the number of colonies which grew on these  media. Finally, the percentage of colonies which did not  grow on the yPe medium was calculated [8]. The obtained results constitute a mean of three or more in- dependently conducted experiments. The mean and standard  deviation were calculated using an excel 7.0 spreadsheet. Experimental Procedures The studies were conducted on a wild strain of the SP – mat alpha leu1 arg4 yeast genotype [10]. The yeast cells  were grown on a liquid yPg medium containing 1% yeast The  aim  of  the  first  stage  of  the  experiments  was  to  study the influence of various concentrations of the pyre- Discusion of Results Table 1. effect of pyrethroids on survival rate and on the number ρ-mutants in logarithmic yeast cells.

The Influence of Selected... throids in question on the survival rate of yeast cells (Tables  1 and 2). it was found that the cells were more sensitive  to these pesticides in the logarithmic stage than in the sta- tionary stage. Loss of viability of all the yeast cells at the  logarithmic  stage  was  achieved  by  applying  deltamethrin  at a concentration of 40µg·cm-3, and cypermethrin and bi- fenthrin at a concentration of 60 µg·cm-3 (Table 1), loss of  viability  of  the  cells  at  the  stationary  stage  was  achieved  by applying deltamethrin at a concentration of 140 µg·cm- and bifenthrin and cypermethrin at a concentration of µg·cm-3 (Table 2). From among the pyrethroids under study,  the toxicity of deltamethrin was the highest; 50% mortal- ity  rate  of  yeast  cells  was  noted  at  the  logarithmic  stage  after the application of deltamethrin at a concentration of  20µg·cm-3, and after the application of bifenthrin and cy- permethrin at a concentration of 40µg·cm-3. Similar differ- ences were noted in the stationary phase, where mortality  rates reached over 50% for deltamethrin at a concentration  of  80µg·cm-3,  and  for  cypermethrin  and  bifenthrin  at  the  concentration of 140 µg·cm-3. In the study of the effect of pyrethroids on the mito- chondrial DNA of yeast cells, the criterion for mutation  was the percentage of ρ-mutants in the surviving popula- tion of cells. The ρ-mutation is manifested phenotypically  as an inability of cells to grow on a non-fermentable car- bon source. It was determined that after incubation with  the pyrethroids under study there was an increase in the  frequency of ρ-mutation among surviving cells, especially  in the logarithmic stage of growth (Tables 1, 2). Discussion Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast is a recognized model  organism used in studies concerning the toxicity of vari- ous  xenobiotics,  including  pesticides.  result  obtained from the conducted experiments make it possible to state  that the examined pyrethroids are toxic to yeast cells. Del- tamethrin had the most destructive influence on the cells;  it lowered their survival rate even when its concentration  was as low as 5µg·cm-3. Comparison of the survival rates  of yeast cells incubated with the addition of pyrethroids  at different stages of yeast growth showed that yeast cells  at their stationary stage of growth tolerate higher concen- tration  of  pyrethroids  than  at  their  logarythmic  stage  of  growth. At the stationary stage of growth yeast cells are  more resistant to the effects of toxic factors, presumably  because the activity of antioxidant enzymes is greater than  in the logarithmic phase [11]. Pyrethroids can affect cells  by generating oxidant stress. This process is accompanied  by a response of the antioxidant system of the cells, mani- fested by a change in the activity of the antioxidant en- zymes, such as supraoxide dismutase and catalase, and by  changes in the concentration of antioxidants [5-7]. Pyrethroids are more toxic compounds for yeast than,  for  example,  paraquat  –  a  compound  which  generates  free  radicals.  Total  destruction  of  yeast  cells  took  place  when the concentrations of paraquat was 2mg·cm-3 [12].  in studying the effect of Fastac 10ec preparation showed  that 50% of the yeast population died when the concentra- tion of alfamethrin was 6.5µg·cm-3 [13]; for human lym- phocytes the cytotoxic concentration of pyrethroids is 3- 6µg·cm-3 [14]. cypermethrin is toxic for rat erythrocytes  at concentrations of 200ng·cm-3 and higher [15]. The study also showed that among the surviving yeast  cultures there are ρ-mutants. loss of mitochondrial func- tions protects yeast cells from the toxic effect of reactive  forms of oxygen. ρ-mutants are more resistant to chemical  compounds which generate reactive forms of oxygen than  wild strains [8]. mutagenic  properties  of  pyrethroids  have  been  con- firmed  by  studying  the  effect  of  pyrethroids  on  human Table 2. effect of pyrethroids on survival rates and on number ρ- mutants in stationary yeast cells.

Krzepiłko A., Święciło A. lymphocytes,  ovary  cells  in  hamsters  and  on  the  meri- stematic  tissue  of  Vicia  faba  and  Allium  cepa  [14]. The  mutagenic  effect  of  supercypermethrin  on  four  different  organisms was compared, and it was determined that it is  not  mutagenic  for  the  strain  Salmonella  typhimurium;  it  induces  point  mutations  in  Saccharomyces  cerevisiae  in  the locus for isoleucine and gene conversion in the locus  for tryptophan. The frequency of chromosome aberrations  was slightly increased in Vicia faba; and no genotoxic ef- fect was found in Drosophila melanogaster [16]. The re- sults of studies on the mutagenic effects of pyrethroids are  ambiguous,  the  difficulty  in  assessing  the  genotoxic  ef- fects of pyrethroids can be connected with the metabolic  activity of the organisms studied [14]. Pollution of the environment with pyrethroid pesticides  is becoming a serious problem. Research conducted in Ger- many  has  shown  that  the products  of  pyrethroid  metabo- lism appear in the urine of people who have not had a direct  contact with pyrethroids [17]. Particularly worrisome is the  fact that, in the authors’ opinion, daily diet is a basic source  of pesticide contamination in the human body. Long-term  exposure to the low dosages of pyrethroids present in the  household or at workplaces (in rugs, wallpaper or fabrics)  causes  chronic  illnesses  [18].  exposure  to  pesticides  in- creases the frequency of cancers in humans. Insecticides,  herbicides and fungicides can cause cancers of the blood,  prostate, pancreas and liver [19]. in humans the number of mitochondrial DNA mutations  increases with age and can cause many diseases and disor- ders associated with old age [20]. it has been determined  that  chemical  compounds  which  induce  ρ-mutations  in  yeast can be carcinogenic for mammal cells, and a process  comparable to the early stages of mutagenesis in yeast cells  takes place in human mitochondria during the onset of de- generative diseases or those associated with age. exposure  to factors causing ρ-mutations may increase the frequency  of degenerative diseases in humans [9].
