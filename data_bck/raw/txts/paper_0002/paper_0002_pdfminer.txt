There is a call for a paradigm shift in developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) evaluation, which
faster, more cost-efﬁcient, and human-relevant test
demands the implementation of
systems than current in vivo guideline studies. Under the umbrella of the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), a guidance document is currently
being prepared that instructs on the regulatory use of a DNT in vitro battery (DNT IVB) for ﬁt-
for-purpose applications. One crucial issue for OECD application of methods is validation,
which for new approach methods (NAMs) requires novel approaches. Here, mechanistic
information previously identiﬁed in vivo, as well as reported neurodevelopmental
adversities in response to disturbances on the cellular and tissue level, are of central
importance. In this study, we scientiﬁcally validate the Neurosphere Assay, which is based
on human primary neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) and an integral part of the DNT IVB. It
assesses neurodevelopmental key events (KEs) like NPC proliferation (NPC1ab), radial
glia cell migration (NPC2a), neuronal differentiation (NPC3), neurite outgrowth (NPC4),
oligodendrocyte differentiation (NPC5), and thyroid hormone-dependent oligodendrocyte
maturation (NPC6). In addition, we extend our work from the hNPCs to human induced
pluripotent stem cell-derived NPCs (hiNPCs) for the NPC proliferation (iNPC1ab) and radial
glia assays (iNPC2a). The validation process we report for the endpoints studied with the
Neurosphere Assays is based on 1) describing the relevance of the respective endpoints
for brain development, 2) the conﬁrmation of the cell type-speciﬁc morphologies observed
in vitro, 3) expressions of cell type-speciﬁc markers consistent with those morphologies, 4)
appropriate anticipated responses to physiological pertinent signaling stimuli and 5)
alterations in speciﬁc in vitro endpoints upon challenges with conﬁrmed DNT
compounds. With these strong mechanistic underpinnings, we posit
the

Scientiﬁc Neurosphere Assay Validation
1 INTRODUCTION
During the last years, enormous scientiﬁc and regulatory efforts
have been focusing on the establishment of a novel procedure for
developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) evaluation (Sachana et al.,
2019). The two main drivers for these efforts were the extremely
high costs that current DNT guideline studies demand and the
resulting overall lack of data, including mechanistic information,
that exists for chemicals concerning their inﬂuence on brain
development. In addition, unique features of the human brain
and its development (Rice and Barone Jr., 2000; Dehay and
Kennedy, 2007, 2009; Somel et al., 2011; Florio and Huttner,
2014; Pollen et al., 2015; Borrell, 2019) strongly support the
general endeavor to use human-derived models for risk decisions
in 21st-century toxicity evaluation (National Research Council,
2007). There is a vast amount of data on different compound
classes including metals, pesticides, and drugs linking compound
exposure to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in children,
like a drop in IQ or memory and attention deﬁcits (Vorhees et al.,
2018). Nevertheless, so far only 110–140 chemicals have been
evaluated using in vivo DNT guideline studies (Makris et al., 2009;
Paparella et al., 2020), while for the majority of the human
lacking (Sachana et al., 2021a).

Moreover, the contribution of chemical exposure to human
neurodevelopmental diseases like autism spectrum or attention

mechanistically substantiated (Grandjean and Landrigan, 2006;
Abbasi, 2016; Bennett et al., 2016; Gould et al., 2018; Moosa et al.,
2018; Cheroni et al., 2020; Masini et al., 2020). Considering the
social, societal and economic consequences that DNT entails
(Bellinger, 2012; Grandjean and Landrigan, 2014), it is obvious
that strategies are needed that allow a faster, more cost-efﬁcient
and human-relevant assessment of DNT for closing this obvious
data gap.

Efforts for the implementation of DNT in vitro alternative
methods for hazard identiﬁcation and risk assessment have been
evolving over more than 15 years (Coecke et al., 2007; Lein et al.,

2015a; Fritsche, 2017; Fritsche et al., 2017). According to the
proposed paradigm shift in DNT testing (Sachana et al., 2019), a
DNT in vitro battery (IVB) was assembled based on
neurodevelopmental key events (KE; Fritsche et al., 2018b)

for a
currently prepared guidance document of the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) with
the purpose to shape a framework facilitating the regulatory use
of DNT in vitro data with ﬁt-for-purpose applications (Crofton
and Mundy, 2021). The guidance document rests on two pillars,
i.e. 1) the data generated through the experimental work
(Masjosthusmann et al., 2020) and 2) the development of a
variety of case studies including integrated approaches to testing
and assessment (IATA) for screening and prioritization. The
OECD guidance document is planned to be published in the ﬁrst

One crucial
issue for OECD application of methods is
validation (Coecke et al., 2007; Gourmelon and Delrue, 2016;
Griesinger et al., 2016). While the traditional practice for assay
validation is lengthy and relies on animal data, new approach
methods (NAMs) need novel validation approaches. Here,
mechanistic information previously identiﬁed in vivo, as well
as reported neurodevelopmental adversities in response to
disturbances on the cellular and tissue level, are of central
importance (Hartung et al., 2013; Leist and Hartung, 2013).
Here the scientiﬁc basis of a test method provides
the
mechanistic rationale for the predictive capacity of the assay.
In addition, reliability, deﬁned by the quality of the test method, is
a crucial parameter. The scientiﬁcally sound, reliable test method
also has to be ﬁt-for-purpose implying that the regulatory
question is known (Leist et al., 2010, 2014). Lab-to-lab
transferability of assays has always been one crucial aspect of
assay reliability. However, when e.g. certain robotics equipment is
available only in one place, ring trials cannot be performed
(Judson et al., 2013).
In this study, we validate the Neurosphere Assay, a high
content assay for DNT evaluation, which is part of the DNT
IVB (Masjosthusmann et al., 2020), using a mechanistic rationale
approach. The Neurosphere Assay is based on human fetal neural
progenitor cells (hNPCs) which are cultivated as proliferative
neurospheres that have the potential to differentiate into brain
effector cells including neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes.
Six early human fetal neurodevelopment key events (KEs) which

Human NPC proliferation (NPC1ab) is a prerequisite for brain
formation, with disturbances causing alterations
in brain
morphology and microcephaly (de Groot et al., 2005). Radial
glia cell migration (NPC2a) generates a scaffold for migrating
neurons during the course of corticogenesis and ensures normal
brain structure and function. Alterations in this KE cause

Disturbances in both directions (promotion or inhibition) are
considered as adverse and are associated with depressive mood
disorders and intellectual disabilities (Song and Wang, 2011;
Guidi et al., 2018). Oligodendrocyte differentiation (NPC5)
and thyroid hormone-dependent oligodendrocyte maturation
(NPC6) are indispensable for the insulation of neuronal axons

All individual test method evaluations are automated, and
concerning the experimental procedures, i.e. most pipetting steps
are performed by a liquid handling system. The NPC2-5 assays
are multiplexed. Quantiﬁcation of differentiated neurons and
oligodendrocytes is achieved by automated image analyses of
immunostained cells that migrate out of the spheres in 96-well
plates using convolutional neuronal networks (CNN; Förster
et al., 2021). All endpoints are then analyzed using the
Omnisphero software (Schmuck et al., 2017). This automated
endpoint evaluation system allows an investigator bias-free,
identiﬁcation of speciﬁc
objective and low hands-on-effort
brain cells that used to be only possible by manual counting.
In addition to cell identiﬁcation, sphere-related endpoints like
radial migration can be assessed. We further add data on the
novel human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived NPC
(hiNPC) assays (hiNPC1/2) investigating similar endpoints. This
hiPSC-based test system provides an unlimited cell source that is
thoroughly characterized in a quality-controlled banking process
(Tigges et al., 2021)
to increasing the
reproducibility of the test results. Furthermore, since iPSCs are
reprogrammed from somatic cells (e.g. ﬁbroblasts), the cell source
raises fewer ethical concerns regarding its derivation process than
primary cell material. However, hiNPCs represent a more
immature developmental stage than fetal NPCs, hence they

Here we present the scientiﬁc basis for the individual NPC test
methods. That the endpoints tested with the Neurosphere Assay
are biologically indispensable for normal brain development
(biological plausibility) was described in detail earlier (Fritsche
et al., 2018b). Therefore, we now focus on the morphology of the
different neural cell types, the expression of cell type-speciﬁc
markers, the responses of the neurodevelopmental processes to
physiological stimuli by using signaling pathway modulators and
the predictive power to identify adverse effects of known DNT
compounds. Together with the biological relevance of
the
endpoint, these ﬁve aspects build the scientiﬁc basis of the

2.2 Basic hNPC and hiNPC Cell Culture
Primary human NPCs (hNPCs) were isolated from cortices of
gestational week 16–19 fetuses and purchased from Lonza
Verviers
SPRL, Belgium (#PT-2599). The hiPSCs were
purchased from Alstem (iPS11) and WiCell (IMR-90, Clone-
4). The neural induction of hiPSCs into human-induced neural
progenitor cells (hiNPCs) was performed in our laboratory as
described in detail in Nimtz et al. (2020). The hNPCs and hiNPCs
were cultured as free-ﬂoating neurospheres in proliferation
medium consisting of DMEM (#31966-021, Thermo Fisher,
United States) and Hams F12 (#31765-027, Thermo Fisher,
United States) in a 2:1 ratio (v:v) supplemented with 2% B
(#17504044, Thermo Fisher, United States), 20 ng/ml EGF
(#PHG0313, Thermo Fisher, United States), 20 ng/ml FGF
basic (#233-FB, R&D Systems, United States), and 100 U/ml
streptomycin (#P06-07100, Pan-
penicillin and 100 µg/ml
Biotech, Germany). Neurospheres were
cultured under
standard cell culture conditions at 37°C and 5% CO2 in 10 cm
diameter cell culture dishes coated with poly-2-hydroxyethyl
methacrylate (poly-Hema; #P3932, Merck, United States). For
cell passaging, once per week, neurospheres were mechanically
dissociated into cubicles of 0.2 mm edge length using a McIlwain
tissue
(#TC752, Campden Instruments, United
Kingdom). Neurospheres were supplied with fresh culture
medium three times per week, by replacing half of the culture
medium.

2.3 The Neurosphere Assay (NPC1-6)
2.3.1 Proliferation (NPC1ab)
hNPC and hiNPC proliferation (NPC1ab assay) was scientiﬁcally
validated by assessing the incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine
(BrdU, NPC1b, #11669915001, Roche, Switzerland) into the
DNA and by measuring the increase in sphere size (NPC1a; 0,
24, 48, and 72 h) using the Cellomics ArrayScan and the provided
HCS Studio Cellomics software (version 6.6.0; Thermo Fisher
Scientiﬁc). In brief, proliferating NPCs of 300 μm diameter were
cultivated for 3 days in 100 µl proliferation medium containing
EGF and FGF basic (detailed composition described in the basic
cell culture section). One NPC neurosphere was cultivated in
100 µl medium in a well of a poly-Hema-coated 96-well plate and
4–5 technical replicates were prepared for each experimental
condition. Proliferating NPCs were further exposed to the EGF
receptor inhibitor PD153035 (0.01, 0.16 and 0.64 µM), known

anti-S100 beta
For the scientiﬁc validation of the hiNPC migration assay,
hiNPCs were exposed to either EGF (0.5–1 ng/ml) alone or in
combination with the EGFR-inhibitor PD153035 (1–2 µM), the
SRC- kinase inhibitor PP2 (10 µM), narciclasine (0.0001–0.1 µM)
or the respective solvent (solvent control). The migration distance
was assessed after 24, 48 or 72 h as described for hNPC
migration below.
2.3.4 hNPC Migration (NPC2)
Upon plating of hNPC neurospheres on PDL-laminin matrices,
NPCs radially migrate out of the sphere core, thereby adapting a
radial glia-like morphology and forming a circular migration
area. The migration distance of radial glia cells (RG, NPC2a) is
assessed manually after 72 h using bright-ﬁeld microscopy and
automated after 120 h by analyzing the ICC stainings with the
software Omnisphero as previously described by Schmuck et al.
(2017). In brief, RG migration is assessed manually on bright-
ﬁeld pictures, taken with the Cellomics ArrayScan using a 50-fold
magniﬁcation, by measuring the radial distance of the furthest
migrated cells to the sphere core as number of pixels following
conversion into µm using Fiji Image J software (Schneider et al.,
2012). After 120 h, RG migration is evaluated automatically by
deﬁning the area of Hoechst33258-stained nuclei as the migration
area of this particular sphere using the Omnisphero software.
Additionally, the migratory capacity of neurons (NPC2b) and
oligodendrocytes (NPC2c), deﬁned as the mean distance of all
neurons/oligodendrocytes within the migration area divided by
the RG migration distance, is automatically assessed after 120 h.
The validation of the NPC2b and NPC2c assay is not included in
this manuscript.
For the scientiﬁc validation of the NPC2a assay, hNPCs were
exposed to human-relevant pathway modulators as well as known
DNT-positives during the 5 days of differentiation. Neurospheres
were differentiated in presence of 1) epidermal growth factor
(EGF, 0.5–1 ng/ml) alone or in combination with the EGF
receptor-inhibitor PD153035 (1–2 µM), 2)
the Src-kinase
inhibitor PP2 (10 µM), 3)

2.3.6 Oligodendrocyte Maturation Assay (NPC6)
The methodology is described in detail in (Dach et al., 2017; Klose
et al., 2021b). In brief, hNPCs were plated on 8-chamber slides
(ﬁve spheres per chamber) and 24-well plates (10 spheres per
well) in differentiation medium containing either solvent or 3 nM
triiodothyronine (T3) and incubated for 5 days on PDL-laminin
matrices. To test for thyroid hormone disruption, hNPCs were
additionally differentiated in presence of T3 with or without
increasing concentrations of
the thyroid hormone receptor
antagonist NH-3 (4–400 nM) or the ﬂame retardant TBBPA
(0.01–1 µM). After 5 days, immunocytochemical stainings for
oligodendrocytes (O4) and cell nuclei (Hoechst33258) were
performed in the 8-chamber
slides as described above.
Imaging of stained 8-chamber slides was performed using the
Cellomics ArrayScan VTI instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc)
and the software Omnisphero (Schmuck et al., 2017). For two
deﬁned areas (1098 mm x 823 mm size) within the migration
area, the oligodendrocyte number was calculated and expressed
as a percentage of the total number of nuclei. Oligodendrocyte
percentages were averaged per sphere and the mean and standard
deviation were calculated for the ﬁve spheres per chamber.
From the spheres plated within the 24-well plate, total RNA
was extracted and 150 ng were transcribed into cDNA using the
RNeasy Mini Kit (#74106, Qiagen, Germany) and the Quantitect
(#205313, Qiagen, Germany)
Reverse Transcription Kit
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative real-
time polymerase chain reactions (qRT-PCR) were performed
with the QuantiFast SYBR Green PCR Kit (#204054, Qiagen,
Germany) and the Rotor-Gene Q Cycler (Qiagen, Germany)
using primers for ACTB (fw: CAGGAAGTCCCTTGCCATCC,
rev: ACCAAAAGCCTTCATACATCTCA), MBP (fw: CAGAGC
GTCCGACTATAAATCG,
rev: GGTGGGTTTTCAGCGTCT
A). Gene expression was quantiﬁed with the copy number
method and MBP expression was normalized to 10.000 ACTB
copy numbers (Dach et al., 2017; Klose et al., 2021b).
The maturation quotient (QM) is then calculated as MPB copy
numbers divided by the percentage of oligodendrocytes within the
hNPC differentiated culture. Therefore, an increase in the QM
represents an increase in oligodendrocyte maturation.
2.3.7 Mitochondrial Activity and Cytotoxicity Assays
Mitochondrial activity and cytotoxicity were assessed in parallel to the
speciﬁc endpoints of the Neurosphere Assay to discriminate speciﬁc
compound effects from unspeciﬁc effects originating from necrosis or
reduced cell viability. After the respective days of chemical exposure,
mitochondrial activity was assessed using the Alamar blue assay
(CellTiter-Blue Assay (CTB), #G8081, Promega, United States). In
parallel, cytotoxicity was determined by measuring the release
of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from cells with damaged
membranes
(CytoTox-ONE Homogeneous Membrane
Integrity Assay; #G7891, Promega, United States). As lysis
control for the LDH assay, neurospheres were incubated for
45 min with 0.2% Triton X-100. Fluorescence was measured
with a Tecan inﬁnite M200 Pro reader (ex: 540 nm; em:
590 nm). The relative ﬂuorescence unit (RFU) values of the
replicates were averaged and medium without cells was used
to correct for background ﬂuorescence. Of note, impaired
radial glia migration and reduced nuclei count correlate with
a reduced CTB value as a consequence of the diminished cell
number within the migration area (Fritsche et al., 2018a;
Klose et al., 2021a). Therefore, in the case of a compound
inhibiting radial glia migration or reducing the nuclei count,
the CTB assay is an inadequate measure of viability and thus
the LDH assay alone should be used as the reference to
identify DNT-speciﬁc effects (Klose et al., 2021a). In the
ﬁgures, except
for Figures 5F+G and Figure 7F, only
cytotoxicity is displayed.
2.3.8 Statistics

3.1 NPC Proliferation (NPC1)
Proliferation is one of the essential neurodevelopmental processes
during brain development and comprises the increase in cell number
through cell growth and division (Homem et al., 2015). Disturbances
in both directions (decrease and increase of proliferation) may result
in neurodevelopmental disorders
such as microcephaly or
megalencephaly, respectively. Microcephaly is manifested by a
severe reduction in brain size and was linked to prenatal
exposure of human fetuses to the Zika virus (Devakumar et al.,
2018). Megalencephaly, on the other hand, is deﬁned as increased
growth of cerebral structures during development and is associated
with metabolic disorders such as L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria
(Pavone et al., 2017). Both microcephaly and megalencephaly

evolution. SOX2 is a marker
Neurospheres are valuable 3D test systems to study NPC
proliferation since they are highly proliferative in suspension
culture in the presence of growth factors (Reynolds et al., 1992).
For our speciﬁc neurosphere test system (Lonza, Verviers,
Belgium), expression of the cell type-speciﬁc CNS neural stem
and progenitor cell markers nestin and SRY-box 2 (SOX2) in
proliferating hNPCs was conﬁrmed (Figure 2D). Nestin is an
intermediate ﬁlament protein type IV (Lendahl et al., 1990) used
as a molecular marker for neuroepithelial stem cells and CNS
progenitors. When human multipotent CNS progenitors
differentiate into neurons and glial cells, nestin expression is
rapidly downregulated in vivo (Dahlstrand et al., 1995)
conﬁrming its usefulness as a neural progenitor cell marker.
transcription factors
SOX proteins comprise a group of
conserved throughout
for
proliferating CNS progenitors and its overexpression inhibits
neuronal differentiation (Pevny and Placzek, 2005). The
primary hNPCs used in this study were double-positive for
nestin and SOX2 as shown in Figure 2D. In total, 76.6, 74.8,
and 76.3% of cells issued from the three different individuals,
respectively, were double-positive for the two markers, and only
1.48, 2.01, and 2.14% of cells expressed none of them, hence
conﬁrming their resemblance to neural progenitors in vivo. The
expression of nestin and SOX2 was assessed in primary hNPCs
previously (Hofrichter et al., 2017). Although the percentage of
cells expressing neither of the two markers was comparable in
these two studies, the average percentage of double-positive cells
was lower in the present study (75.9% in the present study versus
96.3% (Hofrichter et al., 2017)). This might be explained by a
higher passage number (4) of hNPCs used in this study (i.e. the
highest passage usually used within the Neurosphere Assay) in
comparison with passage 0 used in the study of (Hofrichter et al.,
2017). In addition to their expected marker expression, hNPCs
exert the expected morphology (Figure 2A). Neurospheres of a
few hundred µm in diameter consist of individual cells (e.g. one
neurosphere with 300 µm in diameter contains 2.6 x 103 cells;
(Moors et al., 2009)) and display a perfectly round shape with no
disintegrated borders.
The proliferative capacity of hNPCs was assessed by
cultivating
them in either medium supplemented with
(control) or deprived of (w/o growth factors) the human
growth factors EGF and FGF basic (20 ng/ml each). Human
NPCs cultivated for 3 days in control medium increased their
size on average by 33%, whereas hNPCs cultivated in growth
factor-deprived medium (w/o growth factors) did not proliferate
and even slightly shrunk in size by 8.2% (Figures 2A,B). Direct
measurements of proliferation by BrdU incorporation indicated a
78.1% decrease in BrdU incorporation in spheres growing in the
absence (w/o growth factors) compared to the presence (solvent
control) of growth factors (Figure 2C). The proliferative capacity
of Lonza hNPCs was reported previously (Moors et al., 2009;
Baumann et al., 2015; Klose et al., 2021a).

EGFR signaling generally regulates cell proliferation, growth,
differentiation and cell survival (Oda et al., 2005). In the
developing brain, the EGFR is increasingly expressed over
time (Romano and Bucci, 2020) and is mainly found in
proliferating and migratory brain regions (Kornblum et al.,
1997; Caric et al., 2001). The EGFR is therefore indispensable
for proper rodent brain development (Romano and Bucci,
2020). Speciﬁcally, the proliferation of murine neural stem
cells and nestin+ progenitor cells was previously increased by
EGFR signaling in vitro (Sun et al., 2005; Ayuso-Sacido et al.,
2010). In vivo, EGF induced proliferation of stem cells and
progenitors in the murine fourth ventricle and central canal of
the spinal cord (Martens et al., 2002) and ependymal
precursor cells of the adult rat spinal cord (Kojima and
Tator, 2000). Moreover, PD153035 reportedly suppressed
proliferation of murine neural stem cells in vitro (Tropepe
et al., 1999). These data—especially from the in vivo
studies—support the importance of the EGFR pathway for
NPC proliferation.

3.2 Radial Glia Migration (NPC2a)
Fetal cortex development is characterized by different migratory
processes mainly involving radial glia cells (RG) and neurons
(Borrell and Götz, 2014; Falk and Götz, 2017). Human RG exhibit
two distinct
functions, which are prerequisites for cortex
development, especially the higher organization of the human
brain: 1) due to their self-renewing capacity, RG increase the
cortical cell pool before terminally differentiating into neurons
and glial cells. This leads to cortical expansion,
increases
neurogenesis and causes
the characteristic folded cerebral
cortex architecture in gyrencephalic species like humans. 2)
due to their migratory capacity, RG form scaffolds
for
migrating neurons and hence represent the pillars of cortex
formation (Borrell and Götz, 2014; Falk and Götz, 2017). As a
consequence of disturbance of RG function during human brain
development, neurodevelopmental disorders such as heterotopia
and lissencephaly can develop (Barkovich et al., 2005; Matsumoto
et al., 2017; Ferent et al., 2020).
Neurospheres are well-suited cell systems for studying neural
cell migration since without any additional cues the cells start
wandering out of the spheres once they are plated on a suitable
matrix (Zhou and Chiang, 1998; Kukekov et al., 1999). In our

that speciﬁcally measures the
test method (NPC2a assay)
migration distance travelled by RG cells (Moors et al., 2007,
2009; Baumann et al., 2015). In our studies, plating of hNPC
neurospheres on poly-D-lysine/laminin-coated matrices initiates
cell migration in radial trajectories, forming a circular migration
area around the sphere core. After 24 h, the migrated cells exhibit
the characteristic elongated RG-like morphology and express the
RG-markers nestin and GFAP as well as the proliferation marker
Ki-67 (Figure 3A). In vivo, RG are highly polarized and have a
particular elongated morphology since they form processes
extending from the apical
the cortex
(Ferent et al., 2020). In accordance with that, the nestin- and
GFAP-positive cells migrating out of the hNPC sphere core
display an active growth cone protrusion which diverges from
the cell body to explore the vicinal environment (Figure 3A;
Baumann et al. (2015)). The migratory potential of the hNPC-
derived RG is preserved in vitro over the time-course of at least
120 h (Figure 3B). However, a decrease in migration speed can be
observed after the ﬁrst 24 h. Since the speciﬁc RG architecture
provides a scaffold supporting neuronal migration during cortex
development, the correct formation and maintenance of the RG
scaffold is crucial for the organization of neuronal networks and
disturbances correlate with cortical malformations such as
human lissencephaly, polymicrogyria and heterotopia (Ferent

key
During human brain development, migratory processes are
regulated by various signaling pathways, whose activity should be
preserved within a predictive in vitro model. Similar to NPC
proliferation, migration of neural stem cells is regulated by EGF,
exerting its actions through the EGFR (Ayuso-Sacido et al., 2010).
The EGFR is expressed not only in proliferating but also in
differentiating hNPC and was identiﬁed as a human-relevant key
regulator in a gene-gene interaction network involved in hNPC
migration together with SRC-kinase (Masjosthusmann et al.,
2018). Studies on EGFR knockout mice reported a decrease in
brain size, supporting the involvement of the EGFR in migratory
processes during cortical development (Kornblum et al., 1998).
Moreover,
intraventricular administration of EGF caused
migration of subependymal NPCs from the lateral ventricle
into the adjacent neural tissue in the adult mouse brain (Craig
et al., 1996). Similarly, exposure to EGF (0.5–1 ng/ml) after
neurosphere plating enhanced hNPC migration compared to
the solvent control (Figure 3C). In addition, co-administration
of the EGFR-inhibitor PD153035 (1–2 µM) antagonized the EGF-
induced migratory stimulating effect demonstrating EGF action
on NPC migration via the EGFR. As a second human-relevant
key regulator of migration, which is expressed in hNPCs
(Masjosthusmann et al., 2018), we assessed the effects of SRC-
family kinase inhibition on RG migration. SRC-family kinases are
fundamental for brain development and disruption of their
activity correlates with defects in radial migration and reeler-
like malformations of cortical development (Jossin et al., 2003;
Kuo, 2005; Wang et al., 2015). Exposure of migrating hNPCs to
the SRC-family kinase inhibitor PP2 reduced hNPC migration to
40% of
the solvent control without causing any signs of
cytotoxicity (Figure 3D; Moors et al., 2007). Our results
indicate that human-relevant signaling pathways involved in
neurodevelopmental migratory processes in vivo (EGFR and
in vitro
SRC) are preserved in the hNPC-derived cells
supporting the applicability of the NPC2a assay to study cell
migration during development.
In addition to studying signaling pathways, the NPC2a assay is
also able to identify chemicals evidently disturbing migratory

speciﬁc alterations in cell migration and therefore allows for the
detection of chemically-induced disruption of migration in the
context of brain development. Besides RG migration (NPC2a) the

Morphology (NPC3+4)
During cortex development, NPCs including RG cells eventually
lose their proliferative capacity and terminally differentiate into
neural effector cells, i.e. neurons and glia cells (oligodendrocytes
and astrocytes). Neurons then migrate alongside the scaffold of
RG to their ﬁnal destinations, to generate the different cortical
layers (Rakic, 1972; Gilmore and Herrup, 1997). The generation
of sufﬁcient numbers of neurons is a prerequisite for the

intellectual disabilities of patients with Down Syndrome (Guidi

neurogenesis is a major driver of epileptogenesis (Jessberger and
Parent, 2015). Hence, the correct balance of neurogenesis is
crucial for normal brain development.
As a very simpliﬁed model, the Neurosphere Assay mimics
cortex development in vitro since during the time-course of
hNPC differentiation, neurons arise and migrate along the
scaffold of RG cells (Fritsche et al., 2018b). Such young
neurons are typically bipolar in shape and display neurites

Neurogenesis during brain development is primarily regulated
by the Notch signaling pathway, which is evolutionarily highly
conserved and operates at many stages of human brain
development (Yoon and Gaiano, 2005; Louvi and Artavanis-
the
Tsakonas, 2006; Pierfelice et al., 2011). Stimulation of
Notch pathway could be correlated with impaired neuronal
differentiation in vivo (Zhou W. et al., 2016; Zhang et al.,
2018). In contrast,
inhibited Notch signaling is known to
accelerate neuronal differentiation in vitro and in vivo
(Borghese et al., 2010). This can be pharmacologically excited
by the Notch receptor inhibitor N-[N-(3,5-Diﬂuorophenacetyl)-
Lalanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT) through blockage
of
the presenilin-y-secretase complex (Dovey et al., 2001).
Moreover, the Notch pathway is involved in the formation of
long-term memory and is
thus a putative actuator of
developmental disorders (Costa et al., 2005). According to our
comprehensive transcriptomic analysis, differentiating hNPCs
express Notch receptors 1-3 (Masjosthusmann et al., 2018).
Here we show that similar to our previously published work
after 72 h of differentiation (Masjosthusmann et al., 2018), DAPT
increases neuronal numbers to 187% and 439% of the respective
solvent control at 0.12 and 10 µM DAPT, respectively, after
5 days of differentiation. Of note, the total cell number was
not affected, indicating that the increase in neuronal numbers
is at the expense of another cell type within the mixed culture
(Figure 4C). The higher sensitivity of hNPC towards DAPT in
this study is possibly due to the longer experimental time.
Moreover, here we use different individuals compared to the
previous study. These results indicate that the human-relevant
Notch signaling pathway, which is one of the main drivers of
neuronal differentiation in vivo, is also active in the hNPCs
in vitro.
The positive
effect of Notch inhibition on neuronal
differentiation is thought to be - at least in part - attributed to
suppression of the Rho GTPase RhoA (Peng et al., 2019).
Consistent with this notion, narciclasine, an activator of RhoA,
reduced neuronal differentiation of primary hNPCs cultured for
5 days in a concentration-dependent manner, together with a less
sensitive reduction of the nuclei number (Figures 4D,E adapted
from Masjosthusmann et al. (2020)). Increased RhoA activity
correlated with reduced neuronal differentiation of murine neural
stem cells and human iPSCs (Yang et al., 2016; Bogetofte et al.,
2019). In contrast, inactivated RhoA signaling was sufﬁcient to
stimulate axon regeneration and recovery of hindlimb function
after spinal cord injury in mice (Dergham et al., 2002) supporting
the concept of RhoA activity as an inhibitory driver of
neurogenesis.

Consistent with the above-mentioned effect of RhoA
activation on neuronal differentiation (NPC3), narciclasine
also reduced both neurite area and neurite length (Figure 4I
adapted from Masjosthusmann et al. (2020)) within the NPC
assay. This is in line with previous studies, reporting that
narciclasine reduced neurite outgrowth via the Rho-associated
protein kinase (ROCK) pathway in neurons differentiated
from LUHMES human neuronal precursor cells (Krug et al.,
2013). Moreover,
contactin-1 knock-down-dependent
increase in RhoA activity caused morphological alterations
in rat cortical neurons in vivo (Chen et al., 2018). Neurite
outgrowth is further regulated by protein kinase C (PKC), a
serine/threonine kinase, which controls various cellular
responses by phosphorylation of substrate molecules and
alteration of gene transcription (Nishizuka, 1986; Newton,
1995). While PKC activation induced neurite outgrowth in
rat pheochromocytoma (PC-12) cells and primary rat spinal
cord neurons from embryonic day 14 (Hundle et al., 1995;
Yang et al., 2010), inhibition of PKC with the PKC inhibitor
bisindolylmaleimide 1 (Bis-I) reduced neurite growth in PC-
cells (Das et al., 2004), rat cortical neurons and human iPSC-
derived neurons (Druwe et al., 2016). Similar effects were
identiﬁed in the NPC4 assay upon exposure of hNPCs to
Bis-I, which reduced neurite length and area compared to
the solvent control (Figure 4J adapted from Masjosthusmann
et al. (2020)).

and function of the human brain (reviewed in Barateiro et al.
(2016)). However, both pre-OLs and myelinating OLs are
susceptible to various
including oxidative stress,

white-matter deﬁcits manifesting
in clinical pathologies
including the Allan-Herndon-Dudley Syndrome (Sarret et al.,

Since the pool of OLs in humans remains stable after childhood,

the
neurodevelopmental period is crucial (Yeung et al., 2014). The

(Barateiro and Fernandes, 2014; Marinelli et al., 2016). Based
on the marker expression and the highly branched morphology

degree of maturity. Similar to the neuronal differentiation

It is well studied that several signaling pathways, including the

Notch pathway,
(reviewed by He and Lu, 2013). A study on zebraﬁsh embryos
revealed that Notch is responsible for increased production of
OPCs from ventral spinal cord precursors and that the increased
OPC number is not due to increased OPC proliferation (Snyder
et al., 2012). Moreover, contactin/F3-dependent Notch signaling
promoted OPC differentiation from the rat oligodendroglial
OLN-93 cell
line and further increased the expression of
myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG; Hu et al., 2003). In line
with that, differentiation of hNPCs in presence of the Notch
inhibitor DAPT concentration-dependently decreased the
percentage of O4+ cells compared to the solvent control,
indicating that Notch signaling is a prerequisite for hNPC
differentiation into the OL lineage (Figure 5D). In addition,
OL differentiation is negatively inﬂuenced by bone morphogenic
protein (BMP) 7 (Baumann et
and BMP
(Masjosthusmann et al., 2018), proteins of the transforming
al., 2015)
growth factor β family. BMP 2 and 7 also negatively regulated
oligodendrocyte differentiation of primary rat NPC generated
from E17 and PND2 brains (Zhu et al., 1999) and reduced myelin
gene expression in Schwann cells (Liu et al., 2016). These data
demonstrate that two major developmental pathways, i.e. Notch
and BMP, are functional in these hNPCs.
Several studies — including observations in humans —
conﬁrmed that pre-OLs are especially susceptible to oxidative
stress and that pre-OL damage by reactive oxygen species (ROS)
is a potential underlying factor for the emergence of the cerebral
white matter injury termed periventricular leukomalacia (PVL)
(reviewed in Volpe et al. (2011)). In accordance, Guo et al. (2018)
reported that the ROS scavenger vitamin C (ascorbic acid, Asc,
150 µM) enhanced the differentiation of primary mouse NPC-
derived OPCs into OLs and further promoted expression of OL
lineage markers O4, CNPase and MBP concentration-dependently
(Guo et al., 2018). We also observed that ascorbic acid enhanced
hNPC-derived OL maturation (Dach et al., 2017). However, in
contrast to Guo et al. (2018), we did not observe this enhanced
maturation in OLs derived from PND1 mouse neurospheres. This
might be due to different developmental stages of animals as Guo
et al. (2018) used cortices of E14.5 mouse embryos for NPC
generation. Likewise, differentiation of hNPCs in presence of
acid increased the percentage of O4+
100 µM ascorbic
oligodendrocytes within the NPC5 assay by approximately 60%
(Figure 5E). This is in contrast to our previously published data
where ascorbic acid solely induced maturity but not the number of
OLs (Dach et al., 2017), which might be explained by inter-
individual differences of the one individual used in the Dach
et al. (2017) compared to the three individuals in this study.

Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS). These conditions
feature clinical symptoms ranging from mild cognitive deﬁcits to
severe intellectual disabilities (Haddow et al., 1999; Rovet and
Daneman, 2003; Sarret et al., 2010). ADHS is caused by
inactivating mutations in the monocarboxylate transporter
(MCT8), a TH transporter, which is responsible for TH transport
into the brain, and thus required for OL maturation (Vatine et al.,
2021).
Maturation of pre-OLs can be induced in vitro by differentiation
of hNPCs in presence of 3 nM T3 (NPC6). Exposure to T3 clearly
caused the O4+ cells to develop a more mature morphology with
more branched processes (Figure 6A). Moreover, MBP mRNA
expression increases over the time-course of differentiation already
under control conditions, and even further in the presence of 3 nM
T3 (Figure 6B adapted from Dach et al. (2017)). Since MBP is one
of the major components of myelin, hNPC-derived pre-OLs
differentiating in presence of T3 are on the path to myelinating
OLs. In order to quantify the degree of OL maturation within the
NPC6 assay, we calculated the maturation quotient (QM), which is
deﬁned as the mRNA copy numbers of MBP per percentage of O4+
cells within the migration area. In line with the multitude of studies

maturation of hNPC-derived OLs within the NPC6 assay
further reacts to the synthetic antagonist NH-3 (Nguyen et al.,
2002; Singh et al., 2016) since NH-3 concentration-dependently
reduced the QM indicating that disruptors of TH receptor signaling
can be identiﬁed with the NPC6 assay (Figure 6D adapted from

differentiation, TBBPA disturbs TH-dependent OL maturation,
hence concentration-dependently reducing the QM in hNPCs
differentiated in presence of 3 nM T3 (Figure 6E adapted from
Klose et al. (2021b)). Impaired OL maturation is accompanied by
alteration of TH-dependent genes, including EGR1, IGFBP4, IL
and KLF9 (Klose et al., 2021b). These data provide the scientiﬁc
basis for studying the disruption of TH-dependent oligodendrocyte
maturation in differentiating hNPC. In the past, the NPC6 assay
identiﬁed both BDE-99 and perﬂuorooctanoic acid (PFOA) not to
be disruptors of human TH-dependent OL maturation, although
BDE-99 reduced OL numbers (Dach et al., 2017; Klose et al.,

and 3D cultures (Pamies et al., 2017; Sloan et al., 2017; Marton
et al., 2019; Chesnut et al., 2021b). For the generation of OLs,
however, hiNPC differentiation time takes at least 8 weeks
(Pamies et al., 2017) and is therefore not directly comparable
to the primary neurospheres which produce OLs within 5 days of
differentiation. Here we present data on hiNPC proliferation,
migration and the differentiation potential.
When relating hiNPC (Figure 7A) to hNPC neurospheres
(Figure 2A), they display the same neurosphere morphology and
cannot be distinguished from each other with the bare eye.
Moreover, hiNPCs express the neural stem/progenitor markers

SOX2 double-positive hiNPCs

10.6% cells not expressing any of the two markers, which is

individuals (Figure 2). The proliferative capacity of hiNPCs

The proliferation of hiNPCs was also effectively inhibited
by rotenone, an anti-proliferative compound with a known
mode of action i.e. inhibition of the mitochondrial complex I
of
the electron transport chain (Saravanan et al., 2005).
Rotenone produced oxidative stress in iPSC-derived neural
stem cells
(Pistollato et al., 2017) and mitochondrial
dysfunction in human neural progenitor cells (Mahajan
et al., 2019). In the present study, rotenone inhibited the

Next, we inquired whether hiNPC neurospheres can also be
used for studying neural migration. Therefore, we assessed the
migratory capacity of hiNPC-derived cells (passages >17). After
plating on PDL-laminin-coated matrices, the hiNPC-derived cells
formed a circular migration area comparable to the primary
hNPCs. Moreover, as observed for the hNPCs (Figure 3B),

As discussed above, EGFR-dependent signaling guides radial
migration in vivo (Craig et al., 1996; Kornblum et al., 1998). To
study migratory responses to EGF in hiNPCs, we measured the
migration distances of hiNPC-derived cells in presence and
absence of EGF and the EGFR inhibitor PD153035. Similar to
hNPCs, the migration of plated hiNPCs was increased by both
0.5 and 1 ng/ml EGF, which was antagonized by co-treatment
with PD153035 at concentrations of 1 and 2 µM (Figure 8C). Yet
the EGF effects on hiNPC migration were weaker than in
primary hNPCs (122% compared to 130% (0.5 ng/ml EGF)
and 127% compared to 143% (1 ng/ml EGF)). This might be
due to the developmental timing since the density of EGFR
increases processivity through brain development (Burrows et al.,
reduced
1997; Lillien and Raphael, 2000). Hence,
responsiveness of hiNPCs to EGFR signaling could indicate
that hiNPCs represent an earlier developmental time point
compared to fetal hNPCs. However,

differences were minor, additional
studies are needed to

are SRC-kinases
(Jossin et al., 2003; Kuo, 2005; Moors et al., 2007; Wang et al.,
2015). Treatment of differentiating hiNPCs with the SRC-kinase
inhibitor PP2 for 72 h reduced the migration distance to 51% of
the respective solvent control without inducing any signs of
cytotoxicity (Figure 8D). This is comparable to the hNPC
response to PP2 exposure (Figure 3D). Last, we studied the
effects of the RhoA GTPase activator narciclasine on hiNPC
migration. RhoA activation reduced hiNPC migration in a
concentration-dependent manner (Figure 8E). Comparing the
hiNPC results (Figure 8E) to the response of primary hNPCs to
narciclasine exposure (Masjosthusmann et al., 2020), the two cell
systems did not differ in sensitivity (BMR10 0.010 and 0.018 µM,
respectively). In line with our observations, knockout of RhoA
destabilized the actin and tubulin cytoskeleton in neurons and
especially in radial glia cells, resulting in accelerated migration
in vitro and in vivo (Cappello et al., 2012). Hence, narciclasine-
mediated activation of RhoA could cause a hyperstabilization of
the cytoskeleton and thus impair migration. This was observed in
PARK2 knockout hiPSC-derived neurons, where migration was
reduced by RhoA upregulation and rescued by RhoA inhibition
(Bogetofte et al., 2019). Likewise, methylmercury, a metal
disturbing neural migration in humans, affected hiNPC and
hNPC migration at similar concentrations (Hofrichter et al.,
2017).
Taken together, hiNPC proliferation and migration (iNPC1/
2) work similarly as in primary hNPCs (NPC1/2). More work is
needed to understand if these two test systems have also distinct
applicability domains, i.e. concerning developmental timing, or
if these are redundant assays. Nevertheless, primary NPCs

studied the contribution of a variety of signaling pathways
including interleukin-7 (Moors et al., 2009), the extracellular
related kinase Erk1/2 (Moors et al., 2007), NO signaling
(Tegenge et al., 2011), BMP2,

2016; Barenys et al., 2017; Masjosthusmann et al., 2019, 2020;
Klose et al., 2021b, 2021a). In addition, species aspects were
investigated using time-matched (Clancy et al., 2007) rat,
mouse or rabbit neurospheres (Gassmann et al., 2010;
Baumann et al., 2016; Barenys et al., 2017, 2021; Dach
et al., 2017; Masjosthusmann et al., 2018, 2019; Ali et al.,
2019; Kühne et al., 2019; Klose et al., 2021b). On the
regulatory side, data from the Neurosphere Assay was used
for hazard characterization of deltamethrin and ﬂufenacet
building an IATA (Hernández-Jerez et al., 2021). Also, the
application of screening and prioritization was served by the
neurospheres studying banned and currently in use ﬂame
retardants
(Klose et al., 2021a). Last, data from the
Neurosphere Assay contributed to the establishment of
putative AOPs (Bal-Price et al., 2015b; Barenys et al.,
2020; Klose et al., 2021b) demonstrating the usefulness for
helping to frame the regulatory landscape.

Moreover, more radial and astroglia-related endpoints are

cell types are not entirely covered in the current assay setup.
Besides these applications, we are currently enlarging the data
basis for signaling pathways known to be crucial for human brain
development (Fritsche, 2017; Sachana et al., 2021b). Altogether

to determine a toxic threshold dose and deﬁne an acceptable daily
exposure/intake. As an alternative to the approach, known human
exposures can be used as a starting point. As an example, they can
be modeled from average food intake, dermal exposure or
measured as plasma concentrations in epidemiological studies
(Sexton et al., 1995). Moreover, exposure limits from animal
studies that evidently caused a DNT phenotype can be used as a
starting point for the setup of in vitro experiments. Another
important point that needs to be considered is the metabolism
of the test compound in the human body, which is only partially
covered in a human cell-based assay. To some extent enzymes are
present in the different cell types which metabolize the test
compound, however, the complete liver metabolism is absent.
Therefore, the metabolism and distribution of a test compound
have to be modeled using PBK and in vitro screening of metabolites
instead of parent compounds has to be considered depending on
the distribution of the parent compound and metabolites in vivo. In
a neurodevelopmental context, PBK modeling could be used in the
future to calculate fetal brain concentrations
from plasma
concentrations measured in vivo. These values can then be
compared to the PoD values determined with the Neurosphere
Assay.

For studying earlier time-points during development, i.e. the

i.e. neuronal

other assays are necessary. The current DNT IVB is evolving
to close such biological gaps, yet thorough scientiﬁc validation has
to be a prerequisite for each novel test system/method to proceed
from hazard characterization ﬁnally to contributing to risk
assessment
for DNT using NAMs. Our data provide the
rationale for the scientiﬁc validity of the endpoints depicted
with the Neurosphere Assays. Hence, the DNT IVB, with the
Neurosphere Assay as an integral part, is on a solid way to
regulatory acceptance.
