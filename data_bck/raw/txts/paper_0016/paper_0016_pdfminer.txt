Although previous work has tested the  additivity of pyrethroids in vivo, this has not been assessed directly at the primary molecu lar target  using a functional measure. oBjectives: We investigated the potency and efficacy of 11 structurally diverse food-use pyrethroids  to evoke sodium (Na+) influx in neurons and tested the hypothesis of dose additivity for a mixture  of these same 11 compounds. Methods: We determined pyrethroid-induced increases in Na+ influx in primary cultures of  cerebro cortical neurons using the Na+-sensitive dye  sodium-binding benzo furan isophthalate  (SBFI). Concentration-dependent responses for 11 pyrethroids were determined, and the response  to dilutions of a mixture of all 11 compounds at an equimolar mixing ratio was assessed. Additivity  was tested assuming a dose-additive model. results: Seven pyrethroids produced concentration-dependent, tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na+ influx.  The rank order of potency was deltamethrin > S-bioallethrin > β-cyfluthrin > λ-cyhalothrin > esfen- valerate > tefluthrin > fenpropathrin. Cypermethrin and bifenthrin produced modest increases in Na+  influx, whereas permethrin and resmethrin were inactive. When all 11 pyrethroids were present at an  equimolar mixing ratio, their actions on Na+ influx were consistent with a dose-additive model. conclusions: These data provide in vitro relative potency and efficacy measurements for 7 pyre- throid compounds in intact mammalian neurons. Despite differences in individual compound  potencies, we found the action of a mixture of all 11 pyrethroids to be additive when we used an  appropriate statistical model. These results are consistent with a previous report of the additivity of  pyrethroids in vivo. key  words: additivity, efficacy, potency, pyrethroid, sodium influx. Environ Health Perspect  119:1239–1246 (2011).  http://dx.doi.org/10.1289/ehp.1003394 [Online 10 June 2011] Pyrethroids are synthetic insecticidal com- pounds  that  resemble  pyrethrins—natural   toxins present in the flowers of Chrysanthemum  species. Pyrethroids are used worldwide to  control  insect  pests  (Casida  and  Quistad  1998), and the use of pyrethroids has increased  by  as  much  as  25%  since  2000  (Amweg  et  al.  2005;  Spurlock  and  Lee  2008;  U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency 1999). This  increased use carries the potential for increased  human exposure, including pregnant women,  infants, and children, to individual or mul- tiple pyrethroid compounds (Morgan et  al.  2007; Whyatt et al. 2002). Based  on  their  chemical  structure  and  signs of toxicity at high doses (Verschoyle  and Aldridge 1972, 1980), pyrethroids are  classified into two major groups. Type I pyre- throids lack a cyano group at the α-carbon  of the 3-phenoxybenzyl alcohol moiety and  produce  a  poisoning  syndrome  consisting  of  hyper excitation,  tremors,  and  convul- sions  (T  syndrome).  Type  II  pyrethroids  have a cyano group at the  α-carbon of the  3-phenoxy benzyl alcohol moiety and produce  an acute, high-dose syndrome consisting of  hyper sensitivity, salivation, choreo athetosis,  and clonic seizures (CS syndrome) (Soderlund  et  al.  2002;  Wolansky  and  Harrill  2008). The  primary  molecular  targets  under lying  pyrethroid-induced toxicity are voltage-gated  sodium channels (VGSCs) of insects and ver- tebrates (Narahashi 1996; Soderlund et al.  2002). Pyrethroids enhance sodium channel  activity by shifting activation to more nega- tive membrane potentials and by inhibiting  channel inactivation; type II compounds typi- cally produce longer lasting delays in chan- nel inactivation than do type  I compounds  (Narahashi 1996). VGSCs are responsible for  the rapid influx of sodium that under lies the  rising phase of the action potential in most  electrically  excitable  cells,  including  neu- rons, and the difference in actions of type  I  and type II pyrethroids on VGSC kinetics is  hypothesized to contribute significantly to the  T and CS syndromes (Narahashi 1992). Recently,  Wolansky  et  al.  (2009)  pre- dicted  the  effects  of  a  low-dose  mixture  of  pyrethroid  compounds  on  rat  behavior  (motor activity) using a dose-additive model.  An interesting finding in that study was that  both  type  I  and  type  II  pyrethroids  were  dose additive. The use of motor activity as an  end point, however, has the dis advantage of  being a non diagnostic end point (i.e., activa- tion of many neural pathways and processes  decrease motor activity). Therefore, whether this in vivo finding is due to dose additivity at  the molecular target (e.g., VGSCs) remains to  be determined. Little  information  is  available  regard- ing dose additivity of pyrethroids at VGSCs.  Studies of binary combinations of pyrethroids  indicate that type I and type II compounds  may act competitively on VGSCs (Motomura  and Narahashi 2001; Song et al. 1996), but  these studies did not examine concentration– response relationships and were not designed  to test the assumption of additivity. Therefore,  in the present study we determined the relative  potencies of 11 pyrethroids for stimulation of  sodium (Na+) influx in cerebro cortical neu- rons and tested the hypothesis that alterations  in Na+ influx by a mixture of 11 pyrethroids  would be dose additive. Materials and Methods Materials. The pyrethroids (and purity) used  were  deltamethrin  (98.9%),  β-cyfluthrin  (99.2%), cypermethrin (88%), permethrin  (96%),  bifenthrin  (95%),  esfenvalerate  (98.6%), λ-cyhalothrin (87.7%), tefluthrin  (92.6%), fenpropathrin (91.8%), resmethrin  (92.3%), and S-bioallethrin (95.6%). These  compounds  were  from  the  same  lots  used  previously by Wolansky et al. (2006, 2009).  Pyrethroids are chiral compounds and exist  in multiple stereo isomers that have differ- ent  activities  on  sodium  channel  function  (Soderlund et al. 2002).

Cao et al. used in the present study, only delta methrin,  bifenthrin, and tefluthrin were available as  a single isomer; all other compounds were  mixtures  of  two  or  more  stereo isomers.  Complete information on pyrethroid sources  and isomer composition has been described  by Wolansky et  al. (2006) and is available  in  Supplemental  Material  (http://dx.doi. org/10.1289/ehp.1003394). TTX was pur- chased  from  Tocris  Bioscience  (Ellisville,  MO) and veratridine was from Sigma-Aldrich  (St. Louis, MO). Compound preparation. Each pyrethroid  was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)  at  a  stock  concentration  of  100  mM.  An aliquot of stock solution of each pyrethroid  was  then  diluted  using  DMSO  to  give  a  series of secondary stock solutions of 30, 10,  3, 1, 0.3, 0.1, and 0.03 mM. These second- ary stock solutions were kept at –20°C in the  dark. Before each experiment, an equal vol- ume of pluronic acid F-127 (20% in DMSO;  to improve the solubility of pyrethroids) was  then mixed with the secondary stock solution  and diluted 250  times using Locke’s buffer  (8.6  mM HEPES, 5.6  mM KCl, 154  mM  NaCl,  5.6  mM  glucose,  1.0  mM  MgCl2,  2.3 mM CaCl2, 0.0001 mM glycine; pH 7.4).  This dilution in Locke’s buffer resulted in solu- tions of pyrethroid that were 4× the desired final concentrations. To examine the effect  of a mixture of pyrethroids on sodium flux, a  mixture of all 11 pyrethroids was prepared that  contained equi molar concentrations (1 µM) of  each compound in Locke’s buffer. The effects  of this mixture were then tested at different  dilution levels: 100%, 66%, 50%, 33%, 10%,  5%, and 1%; 0.2 % DMSO was added to  separate wells as the control.

from embryonic day 16 Swiss-Webster mice  as  described  previously  (Cao  et  al.  2008).  Cerebrocortical cultures were used in experi- ments between 8 and 10 days in vitro. Sodium  influx  measurement.  Neuronal  intra cellular Na+ concentration ([Na+]i) was  determined by sodium-binding benzo furan  isophthalate (SBFI) fluorescence measure ment  as described previously (Cao et al. 2008). The  background fluorescence of each well was meas- ured in a FLEXstation II (Molecular Devices,  Sunnyvale, CA, USA) before dye loading. Cells  were then incubated for 1  hr at 37°C with  dye loading buffer (50  µL/well) containing  10 µM SBFI acetoxy methyl ester (AM) and  0.02% Pluronic F-127 and then washed five  times with Locke’s buffer, leaving a final vol- ume of 150 µL in each well. Cells were excited  at 340 and 380 nm using a FLEXstation II,  and Na+-bound SBFI emission was detected  at 505 nm. Fluorescence readings were taken  once every 5 sec for 1 min to establish the base- line; 50 µL of test compound solution (4×)  was then added to each well, yielding a final  volume of 200 µL. The cells were exposed to  test compounds for another 4.5 min. Statistical analysis. For sodium influx data,  fluorescence values over time were summed and  the baseline subtracted. We determined the  actions of tetrodotoxin (TTX) on Na+ influx  using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA),  followed by comparisons between specified  treatment groups using a Bonferroni compari- son. To determine the relative potency of each  chemi cal and test for additivity, we applied  the flexible single-chemi cal required method  of analysis (Gennings et al. 2004) to the data,  because preliminary analysis indicated that  the concentration responses for each chemi- cal did not have a common maximum effect  parameter (i.e., they had distinct efficacies).  Details of the analysis strategy are provided  in the Supplemental Material (http://dx.doi. org/10.1289/ehp.1003394). This approach has  been demon strated to be suitable for examining  additivity of complex mixtures, including those  that may contain one or more components that  are inactive or have little activity (Crofton et al.  2005; Moser et al. 2005, 2006). The full model  (a non linear logistic model parameterized as  given in Supplemental Material, Equation 2)  was used to simultaneously fit all of the single  chemical data as well as the fixed-ratio mixture  data. For parsimony, using a backward elimi- nation criterion, the chemicals were grouped  based on their maximum effect parameter (i.e.,  chemicals with similar maximum effect param- eter estimates were grouped to have a common  parameter) thereby reducing the number of  parameters. The output of the full model was  used to calculate EC30 (30% effective concen- tration) values and 95% confidence intervals  (CIs) for each individual pyrethroid that had a  significant concentration–response relationship. Additivity of pyrethroids on Na+ influx Results Pyrethroids produce sodium influx in cerebro­ cortical neurons. A comprehensive study of the  relative potencies of pyrethroids on VGSCs in  intact mammalian neurons has not previously  been  undertaken.  We  therefore  compared  the ability of 11 structurally diverse food-use  pyrethroids to evoke sodium influx in cerebro- cortical neurons using SBFI, a sodium-sensitive  fluorescent dye. Seven of the 11 pyrethroids  tested (tefluthrin, deltamethrin, λ-cyhalothrin,  β-cyfluthrin, esfenvalerate, S-bioallethrin, and  fenpropathrin)  produced  a  rapid  and  con- centration-dependent elevation in neuronal  Na+ influx (Figure 1). The maximum responses  for Na+ influx produced by pyrethroids were  all  lower  than  that  of  10  µM  veratridine  (Figure 1A), a plant-derived sodium channel  neuro toxin site 2 agonist. Two of the 11 pyre- throids tested, cypermethrin and bifenthrin,  caused only modest increases in Na+ flux, and  two others, resmethrin and permethrin, did  not stimulate Na+ influx. To confirm the role of VGSCs in pyre- throid-induced increases of Na+ influx, we  examined the influence of TTX (1 µM) on  the  responses  produced  by  the  nine  active  pyrethroids (10 µM). All compounds except  cypermethrin produced statistically significant  increases in Na+ influx (Figure 2). TTX elimi- nated  this  pyrethroid-induced  Na+  influx,  including the modest Na+ influx produced  by bifenthrin and cypermethrin. These results – TTX + TTX (The EC30 was defined as the concentration of  pyrethroid that induced 30% of the maximal  Na+ influx based on the estimated range of the  data.) We selected the EC30 because this param- eter has been used previously to determine  relative potencies for pyrethroids (Wolansky  et al. 2006, 2009). Thus, our metric for rela- tive potency comparisons are the same as those  used previously. Based on these EC30 values,  the relative potencies of the individual chemi- cals were determined using delta methrin as an  index chemical. We selected delta methrin as an  index chemical because a) there is an extensive  in vitro and in vivo database for this compound,  b) it was the most potent compound in this  assay, and c) it previously has been used as an  index chemical in other comparisons of relative  potency (Wolansky et al. 2006) and mixture  effects (Wolansky et al. 2009). A reduced model  was estimated under the hypothesis of additivity  using all of the data, but only single-chemical  model parameters were used when the predic- tion under additivity was used for the mixture  data (see Supplemental Material, Equation 3).  That is, the reduced model simultaneously esti- mated concentration–response curves for the  single chemicals, and used these to predict the  mixture concentration–response curve using  dose addition. We compared the actual mixture  data with the predicted mixture concentration– response curve, and we used a likelihood ratio  test to test the hypothesis of additivity using an  F-distribution. ** ** ** ** ** ** ** * ## ## ## ## ## ## ## ## ## Control Teﬂuthrin Deltamethrin λ-Cyhalothrin Esfenvalerate β-Cyﬂuthrin S-Bioallethrin Fenpropathrin Bifenthrin Cypermethrin Figure 2. TTX blocked pyrethroid-induced elevation of Na+ influx in neocortical cultures. Cultures were  loaded with SBFI and washed, and baseline fluorescence was determined for 100 sec.

Data (mean ± SE; n = 3–6/treatment) were obtained from two different cultures  performed in duplicate. In the absence of pyrethroid (control), the negative SBFI fluorescence in the pres- ence of TTX indicates an effect of TTX on basal activity of VGSCs. In all cases, TTX significantly reduced  Na+ flux stimulated by pyrethroids. Two-way ANOVA indicated a significant main effect of pyrethroid, a  significant main effect of TTX treatment, and a significant interaction. Step-down ANOVAs followed by  Bonferroni’s comparison indicated a significant effect of all pyrethroids versus control except for cyper- methrin and a significant effect of TTX on all treatments (control and pyrethroid compounds) except control.  *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01 for pyrethroid compared with control. ##p < 0.01 for pyrethroid + TTX compared with pyrethroid alone. ) e s n o p s e r t e n ( e c n e c s e r o u ﬂ I F B S

Cao et al. demon strate that the observed elevation of  neuronal [Na+]i induced by these nine pyre- throids depended on the activation of TTX- sensitive VGSCs. The  concentration–response  relation- ships for all 11 pyrethroids are illustrated in  Figure  3,  and  Table  1  provides  the  model  parameters for the 11 individual compounds.  Fenpropathrin  and  S-bioallethrin  had  the smallest estimated maximum effect parameter  (113.7; i.e., roughly a 14% increase above  control;  see  α6,10  parameters  in  Table  1),  followed by β-cyfluthrin, deltamethrin, and  esfenvalerate (with maximum effects approxi- mately  20%  above  control;  see  α1,4,5);  λ-cyhalothrin,  tefluthrin,  and  the  mixture  produced  the  highest  maximum  increases,  estimated  to  be  about  27%  above  control (α7,11,mix). These data indicate that pyrethroids  have distinct efficacies. Four compounds—  cypermethrin, bifenthrin, permethrin, and  resmethrin—did  not  produce  significant  concentration–response profiles. The small,  TTX-sensitive increases in Na+ influx caused  by cypermethrin and bifenthrin were not suf- ficient  to  model  a  concentration–response  relationship to quantify their potency.

rank order of potency for the remaining seven  compounds was deltamethrin > S-bioallethrin  > β-cyfluthrin > λ-cyhalothrin > esfenvalerate  > tefluthrin > fenpropathrin (Table 2). Permethrin  acts  as  a  low­efficacy  par­ tial agonist in the presence of deltamethrin.  Permethrin  and  resmethrin  were  without  detectable actions on Na+ influx; thus, we  sought to confirm that they inter acted with VGSCs  in  mouse  neurons.  Jacques  et  al.  (1980)  demonstrated  that  although  cis-  permethrin  and  bio resmethrin  did  not  potentiate veratridine-induced  22Na+ uptake  in neuro blastoma cells, they did produce a  concentration-dependent reduction of  22Na+  uptake induced by a combination of veratri- dine  and  kadethrin.

Permethrin  produced a concentration-dependent right- ward shift of deltamethrin concentration–re- sponse curves for sodium influx (Figure 4A).  Accordingly, we analyzed these data by Schild  regression. The slope value from the linear  regression was 1.10 (95% CI, 0.99–1.21),  indicating that permethrin, although lacking  efficacy, inter acts competitively with the same  site on the sodium channel α-subunit as delta- methrin.

A mixture  of all 11 pyrethroids produced an increase  in intra cellular Na+ that was both rapid and  efficacious  (Figure  5).  Using  the  flexible  single-chemi cal required method of testing  additivity, data are consistent with dose addi- tivity (Figure  6; hypothesis of additivity is  not rejected;  p =  0.459). The similarity of  the parameter estimates for the full model  compared with the reduced model (Table 1)  demon strate the predictability of the mean  responses  for  the  mixture  data  using  dose  addition and single-chemical information. Discussion Experiments  in  the  present  study  were  designed  to  test  the  hypothesis  that  the  actions  of  a  pyrethroid  mixture  on  Na+  influx in mammalian neurons could be pre- dicted by a dose-additive model.

An equally weighted mixture of all 11 pyre- throids was prepared such that the concentration  of each pyrethroid in the mixture was 1 µM. After  collection of baseline data, mouse cerebro cortical  neurons were exposed to 0.2% DMSO or 1%, 5%,  10%, 33%, 50%, 66%, and 100% dilutions of this mix- ture, and SBFI fluorescence was monitored for an  additional 4.5  min.

Cao et al. concentration–response relationship for each  of the individual pyrethroids in the mixture.  Using the same 11 pyrethroids that have pre- viously been tested individually (Wolansky  et  al.  2006)  and  in  mixtures  (Wolansky  et  al. 2009) in  vivo, we demon strated that  they stimulate TTX-sensitive Na+ influx in  primary cultures of cerebro cortical neurons  with differing potencies and efficacies. Of the  11 compounds examined, 7 caused concen- tration-dependent increases in Na+ influx,  whereas  2  compounds  (cypermethrin  and  bifenthrin) caused small increases, and 2 (per- methrin and resmethrin) were without effect.  When the action of an equimolar mixture  of these 11 pyrethroids on Na+ influx was  assessed, the effect of the mixture was pre- dicted by a dose-additive model. This is con- sistent with the results of an in vivo mixture  study using motor activity as an end point  (Wolansky et al. 2009) and indicates that both  the behavioral and pharmaco logical effects of  pyrethroid mixtures are dose additive. VGSCs  are  well-established  targets  of  pyrethroid effects and clearly contribute to the  insecticidal and toxicological actions of these  compounds (Narahashi 1996). Thus, effects  of individual pyrethroids and pyrethroid mix- tures on VGSCs reflect the actions of these  compounds at a key molecular target relevant  to their toxicity. The use of a sodium-sensitive  fluorescent dye allowed us to determine the  effects of 11 pyrethroids in a high-throughput  manner without disruption of cellular integrity,  as described previously (Cao et al. 2008). This  pyrethroid-induced Na+ influx depended on

Predicted concentration-addition Empirical ﬁt 4, 2, Mixture concentration (nM) 8, 6, 10, 12, Figure  6.  Observed  sample  means  (circles)  and  model-predicted mean Na+ influx for a mixture of  11 pyrethroids. Means for the mixture were deter- mined by summing the levels of fluorescence inten- sity across the 4.5-min period and subtracting the  background fluorescence. Mixture data were then  fitted to a non linear logistic model, and are pre- sented as the mean  ±  SD percentage of control  values, with controls set at 100%. The predicted  response for the mixture, using only single chemical  parameters, is not significantly different from the full  model, as indicated by the empirical fit. Using this  approach, the mean under additivity is estimated  for mean values less than the minimum–maximum  effect parameter; conservatively, mean values for  concentrations above this constraint were set to  the full model mean estimates. the activation of TTX-sensitive VGSCs inas- much as the response was abrogated by TTX,  a sodium channel blocker. The ability of SBFI  measurements to detect deltamethrin effects in  the nanomolar range indicates that this assay  is similar in sensitivity to membrane potential  (Eells et  al. 1993),  22Na+ flux (Ghiasuddin  and Soderlund 1985), and electro physiological  (Meyer et al. 2008; Shafer et al. 2008) meas- ures,  all  of  which  also  detect  deltamethrin  effects in the nanomolar range. The relative potencies observed in the pres- ent in  vitro study are not identical to those  reported by Wolansky et al. (2006). In that  in vivo study, type II compounds were gener- ally more potent than type I compounds in  both Na+ influx and motor activity assays.  However, the range of relative potencies was  much larger in vivo [230-fold (Wolansky et al.  2006)] than in vitro [3.3-fold present study)],  and the rank order of relative potencies in vitro  differs from that observed in vivo. Several fac- tors are likely to account for these differences.  The smaller range of relative potencies in vitro  reflects the fact that potencies could not be  determined for four of the compounds tested.  These included three (permethrin, resmethrin,  and cypermethrin) of the least potent com- pounds in vivo (Wolansky et al. 2006); thus,  the range of rela tive potencies in vitro may have  been greater if potency estimates for these com- pounds could have been made. The in vitro  system also differs from the in vivo system in  two other important aspects: it lacks significant  metabolic capability, and it consists of a single  tissue. The relative potencies from in vivo stud- ies are influenced by several factors not present  in vitro, including metabolism, contributions  of multiple neuronal pathways, actions on a  greater number of VGSC isoforms than may  be present in vitro, and potentially greater con- tributions of secondary effects of pyrethroids  (e.g., neuro transmitter release). Comprehensive  data sets from other in vitro studies permit- ting  determination  of  relative  potencies  of  pyrethroids are generally lacking. We recently  demon strated that this same set of 11 pyre- throids induced Ca2+ influx in mouse primary  cultures of cerebro cortical neurons with dis- tinct potencies (Cao et al. 2011) that are well  correlated with those reported here for Na+  influx. This is to be expected inasmuch as Ca2+  influx is completely dependent on activation  of VGSCs by pyrethroids (Cao et al. 2011).  Pyrethroids also produced distinct maximum  responses in the increase of neuronal Na+ influx  in cerebro cortical neurons. The different effica- cies of pyrethroids on Na+ influx are consistent  with previous reports that pyrethroids display  distinct efficacies to either augment [3H]BTX  (batrachotoxin)-specific binding (Brown et al.  1988; Trainer et al. 1993) or to elevate brain- derived neuro tropic factor (BDNF) mRNA  expression levels (Imamura et al. 2006). Four compounds (cypermethrin, bifen- thrin, permethrin, and resmethrin) had lit- tle or no effect on Na+ influx in the present  study. Cypermethrin and bifenthrin caused  small  TTX-sensitive  responses,  indicating  that they do inter act with VGSCs in cortical  neurons, but did not produce a response of  sufficient magnitude to be fitted by a logis- tic concentration–response function. These  two compounds also elicited TTX-sensitive  Ca2+ influx in cerebro cortical neurons (Cao  et  al.  2011),  which  further  indicates  that  they  activate  VGSCs.  Our  demon stration  of  the  ability  of  permethrin  to  antagonize   deltamethrin-induced  VGSC  activation  indicates that permethrin also inter acts with  VGSCs  in  cerebro cortical  neurons.  These  results agree with reports of an inter action  between type  I and type  II pyrethroids on  both whole-cell (Song et al. 1996) and single- channel  (Motomura  and  Narahashi  2001)  sodium currents. Similarly, permethrin was  unable to either augment [3H]BTX-specific  binding (Brown et  al. 1988; Trainer et  al.  1993)  or  stimulate  BDNF  mRNA  expres- sion in neurons (Imamura et al. 2006). These  data  are  consistent  with  results  in  neuro- blastoma cells showing that cis-permethrin  and  bio resmethrin  inhibited  22Na+  influx  induced by a combination of veratridine and  kadethrin (Jacques et al. 1980), and with a  report by Brown et al. (1988) demonstrating  that permethrin produced a concentration- dependent reversal of deltamethrin-induced  stimulation of [3H]BTX-specific binding to  VGSCs. Thus, in a variety of in vitro prepara- tions, permethrin and resmethrin are inac- tive alone but clearly interact with VGSCs.  These  data  parallel  an  earlier  report  (Cao  et  al. 2008) demonstrating partial agonism  at neuro toxin site 5 in that treatment of neu- rons with a combination of a high-efficacy  activator (brevetoxin  1) and a  low-efficacy  activator (gambierol) resulted in an inhibi- tion of the response to the high-efficacy com- pound by the low-efficacy compound. This  profile for permethrin is therefore typical of  a low-efficacy partial agonist that can behave  as  an  inhibitor  in  the  presence  of  a  high-  efficacy agonist (Cao et al. 2008). Moreover,  the inference that permethrin behaves as a  low-efficacy agonist is consistent with studies  that demon strate that permethrin increases  open probability of VGSCs. Although previous studies have indicated  that inter actions between pyrethroids occur  in vitro, they have not rigorously tested the  hypothesis of additivity or examined inter- actions between multiple pyrethroids. The  present study was designed specifically to test  the hypothesis of dose additivity for the effects  of multiple pyrethroids. Each compound was  present in the mixture at an equi molar con- centration (~ 1 µM at the highest mixture volume 119 | number 9 | September 2011  •  Environmental Health Perspectives

dilution), which was ≤ EC30 values for six of  the seven individual compounds. Thus, the  concentrations used in the mixture were rela- tively low on the concentration–effect curves  for each individual compound. In addition,  the mixture contained four compounds that  were  without  significant  concentration–  response effects on Na+ influx. The mixture  caused concentration-dependent increases in  Na+ influx, with a maximal effect that was  equivalent to the most efficacious of the indi- vidual compounds. Thus, the hypothesis that  pyrethroid actions on Na+ influx were dose  additive was not rejected. The effects of mix- tures of pyrethroids are therefore additive at  the behavioral (Wolansky et al. 2009) as well  as the cellular level. The statistical model used  in the present study is well suited for predict- ing the additivity of mixtures that contain  components that vary widely in their activ- ity, from very active to completely inactive  (Crofton et al. 2005), such as shown  here  with the pyrethroids. In this case, the four  compounds present were of such low activity  that potency values could not be estimated.  One  (permethrin)  inhibited  delta methrin  actions when these two compounds were pres- ent in a binary mixture. In the 11-chemical  mixture, the net effect of all the compounds  in the mixture did not differ from additivity;  this result reflects the combined action of all  11 compounds but does not make any predic- tions or conclusions regarding the inter actions  of individual pairs of compounds in the mix- ture. If the objective of the present study were  to identify and charac terize the interaction  profile of all chemicals, the study design and  size would be much larger: A factorial design  with  only  three  levels  of  each  compound  would require 311 = 177,147 dose groups.  With  only  two  dose  groups  per  chemical,  2,048  dose groups would be required for a  full factorial design. The fixed-ratio ray design  used  here  is  a  more  focused  and  efficient  design to test for departure from additivity at  relevant mixtures of interest. Its limitation is  that subsets of the 11 chemicals may inter act,  but the overall impact agrees with additivity.  The design and analysis strategy herein cannot  detect or charac terize this scenario. Our results differ from previous reports  where actions of pyrethroids on single-channel   (Song  and  Narahashi  1996)  or  whole-cell  (Song et  al. 1996) sodium currents as well  as large-conductance chloride channels (Burr  and Ray 2004) appeared to be antagonistic  between type I and type II compounds. They  also differ from one report that delta methrin  and S-bioallethrin, at doses that exceeded the  LD50 (dose lethal to 50%) value, did not pro- duce effect-additive or antagonistic changes in  blood pressure, electro myograms, or hippo- campal electro physiological responses (Ray  et  al. 2006). However, these studies (Burr and  Ray  2004;  Ray  et  al.  2006;  Song  and  Narahashi 1996; Song et  al. 1996) did not  rigorously test the hypothesis of additivity  because of limitations in study design and/or   the statistical approach. Dose or effect addi- tivity,  synergism,  or  antagonism  between  mixtures of chemicals can be reliably deter- mined only by hypothesis testing using rig- orous statistical models (Feron and Groten  2002; Gennings et al. 2004; Hertzberg and  Teuschler 2002; LeBlanc and Olmstead 2004;  Teuschler 2007). Pyrethroid  compounds  are  chiral  and  their stereo isomers have differing activities  toward VGSCs (Lund and Narahashi 1982).  Of  the  compounds  used  in  the  present  study, only three (deltamethrin, bifenthrin,  and  tefulthrin)  were  single  stereo isomers  [see Supplemental Material, Table 1 (http:// dx.doi.org/10.1289/ehp.1003394)].  We  tested each compound individually as a single  stereo isomer or group of stereo isomers and  then tested the same single stereo isomer or  group of stereo isomers in the 11-pyrethroid  mixture. The statistical model used data from  the individual compounds (whether a single  stereo isomer or group of stereo isomers) to  predict the dose-additive response and then  determined whether the mixture effects signif- icantly differed from this predicted response.  In the present study, the results did not differ  significantly from additivity, irrespective of  the mixture of stereoisomers present. Conclusions The present study demonstrates that pyre- throids stimulate Na+ influx in mammalian  neurons with distinct potencies and effica- cies. Moreover, we demonstrate that altera- tions in Na+ influx by a mixture of food-use  pyrethroids can be predicted using a dose- additive model. This is consistent with the  actions of these compounds on VGSCs and  is in accordance with in vivo studies of pyre- throid mixtures. RefeRences Amweg EL, Weston DP, Ureda NM. 2005.
