They can, however, have negative effects on  both vertebrates and non-target invertebrate species. In this study, we examined the effects of pulse exposition to different  concentrations of cypermethrin (0.15, 0.015, 0.0015 mg/L) and diflubenzuron (0.15, 0.015, 0.0015 mg/L) on egg hatching  rate, larval growth, and larval survival in a damselfly, Ischnura elegans, and on survival of a crustacean, Daphnia magna.  Insecticide exposure had significant negative effects on hatching rate in damselfly eggs. Exposed damselfly larvae also grew  less and showed a higher mortality than control larvae. In Daphnia, the acute toxicity test (ISO 6341 in Water quality— determination of the inhibition of the mobility of Daphnia magna Straus (Cladocera, Crustacea)—acute toxicity test, Int  Organ Stand Geneve, Geneva, 2012) showed an increased inhibition of mobility in the presence of insecticides. We observed  a proportional response in relation to insecticide concentration, such that the highest exposure levels showed the largest  reduction of vital performances. Our highest tested values correspond to those currently employed in agriculture. This study  suggests that exposure to two common insecticides strongly affects non-target invertebrates even at very low concentration  levels (cypermethrin 0.0015 mg/L and diflubenzuron 0.0015 mg/L).

Due to  the large decline of natural wetland areas, this agricultural  environment has been considered as vicariates for natural  wetlands for waterbirds (Fasola and Ruiz 1996; Lourenço  and Piersma 2009) and other vertebrates (van Dijk et al. *  Marco Cucco    marco.cucco@uniupo.it Erica Subrero  erica.sub84@gmail.com Susanna Sforzini  susanna.sforzini@uniupo.it Aldo Viarengo aldo.viarengo@uniupo.it 1  DISIT, University of Piemonte Orientale, Viale Michel 11, 15121 Alessandria, Italy 2004). Besides, aquatic invertebrates are relatively abun- dant in flooded rice fields with densities of 6.3–31.7 kg/ha  reported in North America (Stafford et al. 2007). However, the possibility for rice fields to act as an envi- ronmental substitute for wetland fauna can be hampered by  an excessive use of chemical products to increase food pro- duction and combat weed, fungi, and undesirable animals.  In particular, there are a variety of products available on the  market for mosquito control. Mosquito larvicides are chemi- cals designed to be applied directly to water to control mos- quito larvae, but they can have negative effects on non-target  species, including human beings (Carvalho et al. 2014). The effect of the application of chemicals on animals  can be examined considering the whole faunal community  (Crossland and La Point 1992; Williams et al. 2002), or the  effects on single species (Beketov 2004; Carvalho et al.  2014). In general, invertebrates can be rather tolerant to  some organic nutrients, i.e. ammonium, nitrates, and phos- phates, but are highly sensitive to pesticides (Pal et al. 2010). Several animal species have been used to assess the pres- ence and effects of pollutants in the aquatic environment, including the invertebrates [mostly insects, crustaceans, and  molluscs (Negri et al. 2013; Malaj et al. 2014)]. Insects in  particular exhibit selective tolerance for the pollutants and  their larval, aquatic stages are ideal to test the effect of insec- ticides for this reason and obtain information on the toxic  properties of substances, solutions, or mixtures (Tang and  Siegfried 1996; Beketov 2004). For their role of intermedi- ate predators in the food chain of lentic and lotic waters,  the Odonata are excellent indicators of environmental health  (Sahlén and Ekestubbe 2001; D’Amico et al. 2004; Smith  et al. 2007; Cordoba-Aguilar 2008; Funk et al. 2009) and  can be used to assess habitat quality with the use of Odo- nate indexes (Chovanec and Waringer 2001; Chovanec et al.  2015). However, Odonates are still little used in ecotoxi- cology (Beketov 2004; Tollett et al. 2009; Buckland-Nicks  et al. 2014), and there are few studies concerning a single  target species (Stewart 1996; Chang et al. 2009). Indeed,  in the last few decades only some studies tested the effects  of herbicides and pesticides on Odonate larval stages, e.g.  azinphos-methyl and carbayl (Hardersen and Wratten 2000),  diflubenzuron (Hurd et al. 1996), avermectin, imidacloprid,  fipronil (Chang et al. 2007; Jinguji et al. 2013), and PFOS  (Van Gossum et al. 2009). Odonates,  and  particularly  the  damselflies  (suborder  Zygoptera), are particularly suitable as environmental pol- lution indicators, because their behaviour is well known  (Corbet and Brooks 2008), and they are also representative  for other aquatic taxa who share many characteristics (Stoks  et al. 2015), are widespread, have limited mobility and long  life cycles, and can be reared in laboratory conditions (Hard- ersen and Wratten 2000). The damselflies’ high sensitivity  to chemicals can be measured not only in terms of mortality,  but also by their body accumulation (Heintzman et al. 2015),  effects on growth, bilateral symmetry, and impaired behav- ioural responses to predators or when feeding (Chang et al.  2009; Van Gossum et al. 2009; Che Salmah et al. 2012). The Daphnia magna is a common water flea widely dis- tributed in freshwater habitats (Barry 1996; Barata et al.  2005), that can be utilized as an indicator for zooplankton  condition (LeBlanc 2016). This species has been used to  evaluate antioxidant enzymes and oxidative stress in rela- tion to UV and oxygen concentration (Borgeraas and Hes- sen 2002), and to assess the toxicity of several chemicals  (Christensen et al. 2005; Beketov and Liess 2008; Toumi  et al. 2013). This crustacean is an important non-target spe- cies, since it is sensitive both at individual and community  levels to pesticides utilized to combat agricultural pest spe- cies (Friberg-Jensen et al. 2003; Wendt-Rasch et al. 2003).  Daphnia magna is placed at an intermediate level in the  freshwater ecosystem trophic chain (Christensen et al. 2005),  hence a reduction of its abundance (Abe et al. 2014) or its  mobility and ability to capture food (Duchet et al. 2011)  will end in a cascade of effects on the whole environment with increased phytoplankton and water turbidity (Friberg- Jensen et al. 2003). The species can be reared and tested in  the lab using standard protocols (ISO 6341 2012), and it is  employed routinely by most environmental agencies. In this study, we tested the effects of two anti-mosquito  insecticides on two non-target species, the Blue-tailed dam- selfly Ischnura elegans (Odonata: Coenagrionidae) and the  Water  flea Daphnia  magna  (Crustacea:  Cladocera).  We  applied pulse exposition to different concentrations of two  anti-mosquito insecticides commonly utilized in rice fields,  i.e. cypermethrin (0.15, 0.015, 0.0015 mg/L) and difluben- zuron (0.15, 0.015, 0.0015 mg/L), and then we examined egg  hatching rate, larval growth, and larval survival in Ischnura  elegans and inhibition of mobility as a standard index (ISO  6348) of survival in Daphnia magna. Materials and methods The cypermethrin [Cyano-(3-phenoxyphenyl)methyl]3-(2,2- dichloroethenyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropane-1-carboxylate,  also known as  Contest® (BASF), is an insecticide used in  the anti-mosquito prophylaxis. It is a broad spectrum, highly  active pyrethroid, which is able to act very quickly and very  effectively against parasites in farms, residential areas, and  areas  of  productive  activities.  This  insecticide  acts  as  a  neurotoxin and is highly stable in daylight and at ambient  temperature (up to 1 year in soil, 5–7 days in water; Agnelli  et al. 2015). Diflubenzuron, N-[(4-Chlorophenyl)carbamoyl]-2,6-dif- luorobenzamide, is an insecticide used in mosquito prophy- laxis acting as a growth regulator. It is able to inhibit chitin  synthase enzyme, thus preventing the deposition of chitin  during larval moulting (Miyamoto et al. 1993; EPA 1997). The trials with diflubenzuron were carried out at concen- trations 0.15, 0.015, and 0.0015 mg/L. The test concentra- tions were obtained using 1, 0.1, and 0.01 μL/L, respectively,  of the Device SC-15® of Chemtura, UK. Diflubenzuron was  applied in three different experiments: in the first the insecti- cide was administered to the eggs of Ischnura elegans, in the  second experiment it was administered to larvae of Ischnura  elegans 2 days after hatching, and in the third experimen- tal set-up we tested the effects on Daphnia magna through  the inhibition of mobility test (ISO 6341 2012). Similarly,  we carried out three experiments (insecticide administered  to Ischnura eggs and to larvae and the immobility test for  Daphnia)  with  the  alfa-cypermethrin  at  concentrations  0.0015, 0.015 and 0.15 mg/L. The test concentrations were  obtained using 1, 0.1, and 0.01 mg/L, respectively, of the   Contest® product by BASF AGRI, France. For both chemi- cals, the higher concentration, equal to 0.15 mg/L, is equiva- lent to the dose normally used in rice fields (IPCS 1992;  European Union Competent Authority Report 2007), and the According to the report (De Block and Stoks 2008), Artemia  nauplii were the only food item provided throughout the rear- ing period. In order to assess the effects of insecticides on  growth and mortality, we carried out counts and measurements  of the larvae twice a week. Daphnia magna: acute immobilization test The test followed the ISO 6341 (2012) standard specifica- tions  for  water  quality  (utilized  water:  pH  7.46;  bicarbo- nates 296 mg/L, calcium 51.4 mg/L; magnesium 29.7 mg/L,  nitrates 9 mg/L; sodium 6 mg/L; sulphates 4.2 mg/L; chlo- rides 2.6 mg/L; potassium 0.97 mg/L; fluorides < 0.1 mg/L)  and the standard OECD (2004) No 202 acute immobilization  test. Ten newly hatched daphnids (aged less than 24 h) were  placed in glass beakers (100 ml) and exposed to the pesticides  at 20 ± 2 °C, with a 16/8 h light–dark cycle. Four replicates  were made per treatment (i.e. 40 animals per each pesticide  concentration and 40 animals in the control group). The num- ber of immobile animals was counted after 24 and 48 h. Statistics The software R (R Core Team 2016) was used in all statistical  analyses. Hatching rate is a binomial variable, with 0 and values for unhatched and live individuals respectively. Hatch- ing rate in control versus the three experimental groups was  compared using a logistic model, with hatching as a binomial  dependent variable, insecticide concentration as a fixed effect,  and female ID as a random component (package lme4). Mor- tality rate was compared for each larval group tested using  a standard survival analysis, with Kaplan–Meier estimates.  We utilized the survival analysis implemented in the survival  packages (Fox and Carvalho 2012; Therneau 2015) for R  Commander (Fox 2005). In the models, female ID was entered  as a random effect using the “frailty” function. To identify  significant effects of pesticide concentration on growth, we  used a mixed model ANOVA. Insecticide concentration with  four levels (0.15, 0.015, 0.0015 mg/L) was inserted as the fixed  component of the models, whereas the random component was  female ID. Differences in response of Daphnia to an acute  immobilization test were verified by comparison of the values  measured in the experimental groups with respect to control  values (Mann–Whitney U test). other doses are then diluted respectively 10 and 100 times.  Finally, we conducted three experiments (on Ischnura eggs,  Ischnura larvae and Daphnia, respectively) using a mixture  of the two insecticides, both dosed at the lowest concentra- tion levels, i.e. 0.0015 mg/L. As recently reviewed, the biological effect of insecti- cides can vary according to the concentration but also to the  time of exposure, i.e. chronic or pulse contact (Tennekes  and Sánchez-Bayo 2013). Our protocol included a single  pulse exposure and was designed to simulate realistic field  exposure conditions where administration of the chemicals  to rice fields typically occurs only once by small aircrafts  or vehicles from the ground. In our experimental setup, the  administration of insecticides took place only once, with- out any subsequent addition. In the experiment with eggs,  chemicals were added to water 1 day after the oviposition,  while in the experiment with larvae, they were administered  2 days after hatching. Maintenance of Ischnura elegans Blue-tailed damselflies can be easily reared (Piersanti et al.  2015) and utilized in eco-toxicological studies (Van Praet  et al. 2012,  2014a,  b, c). Pairs of mating damselflies (a  male and female that were found joined in the typical wheel  shape) were collected with a hand net in the field from the  grass vegetation near the edge of a small lake (formerly a  quarry site), located close to our lab in Alessandria, NW  Italy. The lake is located in an agricultural area with fields  of wheat and corn and is located about 15 km from the near- est paddy fields area. No larvae were collected directly in  the field. In the lab, mating pairs were first kept in a large  cage, and then when copulation and male clasping ended,  the males were released while each female was inserted in  a separate cup with water and a wet filter paper sheet. In  the following hours, laying females readily utilized the wet  paper as a substrate for oviposition of fecundated eggs. After  laying, females were released and eggs were counted. On  average, each female laid a mean of 120.1 ± 12.8 SE eggs.  The filter paper containing the entire clutch was cut into  four portions containing an approximately equal numbers of  eggs, and each portion was randomly allocated to a different  experimental dose of insecticide (cypermethrin: 0.15, 0.015,  0.0015 mg/L, and control group; diflubenzuron: 0.15, 0.015,  0.0015 mg/L, and control group). Each group of eggs was maintained in a tray (23 × 30 cm)  filled with spring water up to 2 cm depth. We utilized moun- tain spring water that had been bottled by a commercial com- pany for human drinking (Fontebracca. pH: 7.6; EC: 424 µS/ cm; TOC: 15.0 mg/L; nitrates: 1.6 mg/L). Eggs were counted  at the beginning and checked for hatching each day. After  15–18 days, the larvae emerged from the eggs and were kept  in individual dishes (20 cm diameter) to prevent cannibalism. Results Cypermethrin Treatment on eggs The survival of larvae hatched from eggs treated with cyper- methrin was low during the first 6 days after hatching. The  three different insecticide concentrations had a significant  influence (all P < 0.01) on survival (Table 1), resulting in  a higher value in larvae treated with a lower dose and an  almost total mortality within the first 8 days regarding the  larvae treated with the highest concentration (Fig. 1a). Larvae of the control group grew slightly but not sig- nificantly faster than larvae pertaining to the 0.0015 mg/L  group (F1,640 = 1.289;  P = 0.19). Growth of the other two  experimental groups cannot be compared, because the very  high mortality reduced their number and prevented the pos- sibility of performing any statistical comparison. Treatment on larvae Figure 1b shows the survival of larvae that were treated with  cypermethrin after their hatching. Survival was significantly  lower in the groups treated with the insecticide with respect  to the control group (Table 1). Along the first 20 days, lar- vae treated with the low dose of insecticide had a lower  mortality than the larvae treated with the middle and high  concentration, but afterwards, mortality was almost total for  all groups (Fig. 1b).

The survival of larvae hatched from eggs treated with  diflubenzuron was low following the first days after hatch- ing. Different insecticide concentrations had a significant  influence on survival (Table 3), resulting in a higher value  in the larvae treated with a lower dose and an almost total  mortality  within  the  first  10  days  regarding  the  larvae  treated with the highest concentration (Fig. 3a).

Daphnia magna The immobilization test showed a significantly negative  effect of the treatment with cypermethrin plus diflubenzu- ron (Mann–Whitney U tests, P < 0.01). The negative effect  appeared within 24 h and was stronger after 48 h (Fig. 2c). Discussion In this study, we investigated the effects of exposure to sev- eral different concentrations of two insecticides, cyperme- thrin and diflubenzuron, on hatching rate, growth, and sur- vival of the Blue-tailed damselfly, Ischnura elegans, and on  the inhibition of mobility in the Water flea, Daphnia magna.  We found that insecticide exposure elicited significant nega- tive effects on all examined biological parameters. Cypermethrin is a pyrethroid used in agricultural applica- tions and in consumer products for domestic purposes. The  molecule acts as a neurotoxin on insects. The diflubenzuron  is an insecticide used in mosquito prophylaxis. As a growth  regulator, it is able to inhibit the chitin synthetase enzyme,  thus preventing the deposition of chitin during larval moult- ing (Korytko and Scott 1998). Several insecticides can affect  the abundance of species and the structure of invertebrate  communities (Hurd et al. 1996; Suhling et al. 2000; Friberg- Jensen et al. 2003; Berenzen et al. 2005; Schäfer et al. 2007).  Larvae from the dragonfly Sympetrum infuscatum exposed  to imidacloprid, a neurotoxic neonicotinoid, showed a sig- nificant  increase  in  mortality  soon  after  administration.  Besides, the insecticide caused a decrease in zooplankton  resulting in an indirect negative effect (Jinguji et al. 2013).  The hatching rate of the damselfly Xanthocnemis zealandica  was reduced by organophosphates and carbammates (Hard- ersen and Wratten 2000). The impact of organophosphate  sublethal doses can involve the impairment of predator and  antipredator behaviours (Van Dinh et al. 2014), as well as  food intake which in turn can delay the emerging date and  reduce body mass (Janssens et al. 2014), with an overall  decrease in fitness (Stoks and Cordoba-Aguilar 2012). During the field application of insecticides, the chemicals  can reach the non-target invertebrate species when they are  at the egg or larval stages. However, little is known about  effects at the egg stage. In this study, we found a decrease  in hatching rate after application of diflubenzuron to eggs.  The coat enveloping the eggs derives from the chorion, and  performs an adhesive function plus a protective role during Fig. 3   Diflubenzuron:  effect  of  different  concentrations  on  Ischnura  elegans larval mortality.

Survival rate indicates the ratio between num- ber of surviving larvae to all hatched larvae Treatment on Daphnia magna The immobilization test showed a negative effect of the treat- ment with cypermethrin (Mann–Whitney U tests, P < 0.01)  and was similar regardless of the insecticide concentration  (Fig. 2b). The negative effect appeared within 24 h in all  groups and was stronger after 48 h (Fig. 2b). Mixture of cypermethrin and diflubenzuron Treatment on eggs In the experimental group, the mixture of cypermethrin and  diflubenzuron caused the death of all the larvae hatched from  the treated eggs within 24 h after hatching. egg segmentation (Gaino et al. 2008). The protection pro- vided by the egg coat of Ischnura elegans was not adequate  enough to defend the developing embryo from the nega- tive effect of chemicals, as mirrored by the lower hatching  rate and lower survival of the larvae derived from the few  hatched eggs. A high sensitivity of Odonates at the egg stage  has been reported in a few other cases with effects span- ning from immediate effects during exposure (Hardersen  and Wratten 2000; Bots et al. 2010; Andrew 2012) to even  stronger delayed postexposure effects on larvae (Debecker  et al. 2017; Fontana-Bria et al. 2017). When insecticides were applied at the Ischnura elegans  larval stage, again we observed a negative effect of chemi- cals with a higher mortality in exposed larvae with respect  to the controls. The growth of the few larvae that survived  was lower compared to the growth of control group; this  is an indication of long lasting effects from a single pulse  application of insecticides. Our results are similar to those  reported on the same species for other pollutants (Van Praet  et al. 2014b) and to those reported for our same two insec- ticides in other arthropods (Savitz et al. 1994; Chen et al.  2008; Seccacini et al. 2008; Weston et al. 2015), or on insect  communities (Sundaram et al. 1991; Schäfer et al. 2007). The results obtained from testing of the two insecticides  on Daphnia magna indicate that immobility in individuals  treated with the two substances is linked to the presence of  the chemicals and to the level of concentration administered.  In particular, the results show that the highest inhibition of  mobility is linked to the higher concentrations. The mixture  of the two insecticides had a negative effect even at the low- est concentration. Similar negative effects of cypermethrin  on Daphnia were found in other studies through tests per- formed with acute, pulse, and chronic administration (Lakota  et al. 1989; Kim et al. 2008). The immobility is a good pre- dictor of mortality. The first effect of a reduced mobility of  Daphnia in the presence of harmful chemicals is a decrease  in feeding efficiency mirrored by a low content of chloro- phyll pigments in the gut (Christensen et al. 2005). The test  can be used to detect negative effects besides other sublethal  endpoints previously used in other studies, including clutch  size and adult size as indices of fecundity and growth rate  (Kashian and Dodson 2002). Concerning diflubenzuron, other authors found a nega- tive effect of this chemical on Daphnia magna (Kashian and  Dodson 2002), suggesting that application of the insecticide  will end in an increased environmental risk for the species  (Abe et al. 2014). Alongside the acute consequences mir- rored by the immobility test, long-term effects of diflubenzu- ron on Daphnia were also verified through the reproduction  test (Duchet et al. 2011). Similarly to cypermethrin, other pyrethroids used in agri- culture were found to have negative effects on Daphnia. An  analysis of acute and chronic toxic effects of deltamethrin detected consequences for survival correlated with the deliv- ered concentration resulting in an increase in embryonic  deformations; deltamethrin was found to be an endocrine  disruptor that interferes with sex determination and leads  to significant abnormalities in development (Toumi et al.  2013). Another study found a dose-dependent response in  the treatment of Daphnia with the pyrethroid fenvalerate; in  particular, it was noted that this substance delays the age of  first reproduction, and this delay is associated at lower doses  to a reduction in the number of young per female and at  higher concentrations to an inhibition of population growth  (Reynaldi and Liess 2005). The dose sufficient to determine a negative effect on Odo- nates can be very small, particularly when considering the  effects on behaviour, that represents a highly sensitive and  integrated response to internal and external conditions (Van  Gossum et al. 2009). There are no previous studies testing  cypermethrin and diflubenzuron in damselflies. However,  it is known that the effects of other pyrethroids was signifi- cant at concentration as low as 0.01 µg/L (Beketov 2004) or  0.1 µg/L (Schroer et al. 2004; Reynaldi and Liess 2005), i.e.  a range of values similar to those found in our study. The concentration of insecticides that was found to sig- nificantly affect Daphnia depends on the biological param- eter considered. Mortality EC50-values were 0.87 µg/L and  0.36 µg/L in two studies for cypermethrin (Lakota et al.  1989; Westergaard et al. 2012), while sublethal effects were  observed between 0.05 and 0.6 µg/L (Christensen et al.  2005). Likewise, the diflubenzuron showed a high toxicity  to D. magna (0.03–0.01 µg/L), indicating that the use of the  substance could result in a high environmental risk for this  species (Abe et al. 2014). Results from our study confirm  that even a low dose of these two insecticides can have a  significant effect on the water flea. Concentrations tested in this study for cypermethrin and  diflubenzuron lie within the concentration range occurring  in freshwater systems after pesticide application (Pistoc- chi et al. 2009; Feo et al. 2010b; Aznar et al. 2017). The  doses tested are environmentally relevant concentrations that  reflect a realistic risk for the two insecticides, or mixtures of  the two chemicals, to non-target species (Fischer and Hall  1992; Konstantinou et al. 2006; Feo et al. 2010a). The exact  concentration in freshwater environments depends on sev- eral factors, among others the degradation time in the water  phase, the condition and chemistry of soil, and the intensity  and duration of light hours (Lewis et al. 2016). Although  the degradation rate of the insecticides used in this study  is fast (2/3 days; cypermethrin: IPCS 1992; diflubenzuron:  IPCS 1995), it should be noted that, as mentioned above,  the concentrations detected in paddy waters are similar to  those tested in this study. Therefore, our data on the additive/ synergic effects of diflubenzuron and cypermethrin clearly  indicate a real possibility of risk for non-target freshwater organisms. This fact is relevant when considering that, in  water samples collected in our study area, tens of differ- ent pesticides have been identified to be present (IPSRA  2018). Moreover, the simple evaluation of each pesticide  concentration doesn’t consider the fact that at least some of  their degradation products could maintain a certain level of  toxicity. The study of ecotoxicity of the pesticide’s degrada- tion products is only at an initial stage and may represent an  important aspect of the future research development in this  field (Fenner et al. 2013). Conclusions Our study shows that insecticides utilized in rice-fields to  control mosquitoes have negative effects on non-target spe- cies. Insecticides dispersed in the freshwater environment  are relatively mobile and wash into water bodies near agri- cultural areas. Even if major damages are likely to occur  using the more persistent molecules (Diana et al. 2000),  this study shows that even pulse applications of short-living  chemicals can negatively affect freshwater species. This  negative effect is of particular importance for non-targeted  species, such as the Odonates, an invertebrate group that  is of particular conservation concern and includes several  species listed as endangered in European directives (Boudot  and Kalkman 2015). As the effects of compounds with a  similar mode of action were found to be comparable (Van  Wijngaarden et al. 2005), this study can help ameliorate the  use of chemicals in an agricultural environment, and contrib- ute to enhancing the protection of non-target invertebrates.
