Fenvalerate  and  permethrin  were  tested  with  two  different  concentrations  of Cyt-B (3  and  6/xg/ml). At  the  concentration  ranges  tested,  all  the  five  pyrethroids  induced  clear  dose  dependent  cytotoxic  effects,  fenpropathrin  being the  most toxic.  Nuclear  division  index (NDI) and  the  newly introduced  index of cytotoxicity, the  cytokinesis block proliferation  index (CBPI),  reflected  the  dose  dependency  more  accurately  than  the  percentage  of  binucleated  cells  did.  CBPI  is  similar  to  NDI  except  that  it  estimates  the  average  number  of cell  divisions  that  the  cell  population  has  gone  through,  and,  therefore,  classifies  both  trinucleate  and  tetranucleate  cells  into  the  same  category. Cypermethrin  and  fenpropathrin  slightly  increased  the  number  of MN  and  micronucleated  cells  in  WB  lympho-  cyte  cultures  from  two  out  of the  three  donors.  Deltamethrin  produced  a  positive  response  only in  WB  cultures  of  one  donor  and  in  IL cultures  of another  donor.  Permethrin  gave  mostly  negative  results,  although  it  increased  the  MN  frequency in  WB cultures  of one  donor when  6/~g/ml  Cyt-B was  used.  Fenvalerate  did  not  significantly induce  MN.  With  certain  reservations  to  the  purity  and  isomer  composition  of  each  pesticide,  the  existing  information  appears  to support  the  idea  that  pyrethroid  insecticides  have  a weak (cypermethrin,  deltamethrin  and  fenpropathrin)  or  nule  (fenvalerate  and  permethrin)  genotoxic activity in  vitro.

Introduction Synthetic  pyrethroids  are  highly  active  insecti-  relatively cides  characterized  by  photostability, in  plants toxicity  and  low  production  of  low  m a m m a l i a n   residues  ( P a p a d o p o u l o u - M o u r k i d o u ,   1983;  Vijverberg  and  van  der  Bercken,  1990).  synthetic  Deltamethrin,  pyrethroid,  is  600  times  m o r e   active  than  D D T   against  A n o p h e l e s   stephensi  (Zerba,  1988). as  an  example  of  a * Corresponding  author.

Surrall~s  et al. /  Mutation  Research  341  (1995)  169- throid  insecticides  are  becoming  widespread  and,  therefore, studies on the biological effects of these  pesticides  are  of  immediate  concern.  Numerous  studies  on  their  toxicity both  in  insects  and  mam-  mals  have  been  reported  in  the  literature  (for  detailed  description  on  biological  activity,  mode  of  action,  metabolism  and  toxicity,  see  Aldridge,  1990).  The  genotoxicity  of  these  chemicals  has  been  an  important  research  line  in  our  laboratory  (Barcelona)  during  the  last  10  years  (Batiste-  Alentorn  et  al.,  1986,  1987;  Puig  et  al.,  1989;  Carbonell  et  al.,  1989;  Surrall6s  et al.,  1990;  Pardo  et  al.,  1993).  Although  pyrethroid  insecticides  have  consistently shown  negative  results  in  micro-  bial  genotoxicity  tests,  the  outcome  of  other  as-  says  has  been  variable  and  it  has  not  been  possi-  ble  to  draw  definite  conclusions  about  the  geno-  toxicity of this  group  of  pesticides. The  present  study  deals  with  the  genotoxicity  of  five  synthetic  pyrethroid  insecticides  currently  used  in  modern  agriculture  in  great  extent:  cyper-  methrin  (Cyp),  deltamethrin  (Del),  fenpropathrin  (Fep),  fenvalerate  (Fev),  and  permethrin  (Per).  These  chemicals  are  carboxylic  acid  esters  with  three  chirial  centres  located  at  carbons  1 and  3 of  the  cyclopropane  ring  and  at  the  a-carbon  of the  alcohol  moiety.  All  of  them,  except  permethrin,  have  a  cyano  group  which  has  been  related  to  mammalian  toxicity (see  Fig.  1). The  genetic  end-point  chosen  for  this  study  was  the  micronucleus  assay  in  cultured  human  (MN)  are  acentric  iymphocytes.  Micronuclei  chromosome  fragments  or  whole  chromosomes  that  are  left  behind  during  mitotic  cellular  divi-  sion  and  appear  in  the  cytoplasm  of  interphase  cells  as  small  additional  nuclei.  The  cytokinesis  block  micronucleus  (CBMN)  assay  (Fenech  and  Morley,  1985),  using  cytochalasin-B  (Cyt-B)  to  identify  cells  that  have  divided  once  in  vitro,  has  made  the  identification  of  MN  a  useful  tool  for  assessing  genetic  damage. Among  the  five  pyrethroids  studied  here,  Fen  and  Per  have  earlier been  shown  to  induce  MN  in  human  lymphocytes  (Surrall6s  et  al.,  1990;  Bar-  rueco  et  al.,  1992).  Thus,  the  main  aim  of  this  study  was  to  investigate  the  ability  of  the  five  pyrethroids  to  induce  MN  and  to  reevaluate  the  MN  induction by Fev  and  Per by using  a  different H3C  CH CII~C~CH / / ~ C--O  -

Previous  studies  have  demonstrated  that  the  concentration  of  Cyt-B  is  an  important  variable  affecting  the  efficiency  of  the  cytokinesis  block  (Littelfield  et  al.,  1989;  Surrall6s  et  al.,  1992,  1994)  and  the  baseline  and  induced  frequency of  MN  (Surrall6s  et  al.,  1992,  1994).  We  have  sug-

Migliore  et  al.  (1989) gested  that,  especially when  a  suboptimal  Cyt-B  concentration (such  as  3  ~ g / m l )   is used  to  block  cytokinesis,  binucleated  cells  that  have  actually  divided  twice  are  included  in  the  scoring  (Lin-  dholm et  al.,  1991; Norppa  et  al.,  1993; Surrall6s  et  al.,  1994).  This  fact  could  lead  to  an  overesti-  mation of genetic damage (Surrall6s  et  al.,  1994).  that  whole-blood (WB)  cultures should be  used  in the  CBMN  assay.  However,  it was  recenty suggested  that  the  sensitivity  of  the  CBMN  assay  may  be  enhanced  by  using  isolated  lymphocytes (IL)  in-  stead of WB (Van Hummelen and Kirsch-Volders,  1992;  Elhajouji  et  al.,  1993). Therefore,  the  five  pyrethroids were  tested  in  both  WB  and  IL  cul-  tures,  to  see  if one  type  of culture  is  superior  to  the  other. recommended 2.  Materials  and  methods Cytogenetic  m e t h o d s Blood  was  obtained  by  venipuncture  from  healthy non-smoking  donors  aged  from  25  to years  and  with  no  previous  known  contact  with  high concentrations of pesticides. WB  cultures were  set  up  as  described  by Sur-  rall6s  et  al.  (1992).  Briefly,  0.5  ml  of  blood  was  added  to  4.5  ml  of  culture  medium  containing  RPMI  1640,  15%  heat-inactivated  foetal  calf  serum  (FCS),  antibiotics,  L-glutamine and  phyto-  haemagglutinin (PHA).  IL cultures were based on  the  method  described  by  Lindholm et  al.  (1991).  Mononucleated  cells  were  isolated  in  Lympho-  prep  and  a  total  of one  million cells were  added  to  5  ml  PRMI  1640 medium  supplemented  with  15%  FCS,  antibiotics, L-glutamine, and  PHA.  All  the  cultures were  incubated  at  37°C for 72  h. Treatments  were  performed  at  24  h  after  cul-  ture initation and were prolonged until the end of  the  culture.  Cyt-B  (Sigma,  St.  Louis,  MO,  USA)  was added at 44 h, at  a concentration of 6 / z g / m l   (all  treatments)  or  3  /zg/ml  (parallel  cultures  of  Fev and  Per,  donor  C). The  WB  cultures  were  harvested  at  72  h  by  gently rinsing the  cells  in  serum-free  RPMI medium  at  room  temperature.  Following a  short  hypotonic treatment with  KCL (0.075 M  at  room  temperature), the cells were fixed three times in a solution  consisting of  5  parts  of  methanol  and part  of  acetic  acid.  Finally,  the  centrifuged  cells  were  dropped  onto  clean  slides  and  stained  with  Giemsa  (Surrall6s  et  al.,  1992). The  IL  cultures  were  harvested  by  centrifugation  and,  after  two  rinses in PBS at room temperature, the cells were  centrifuged  directly  onto  slides  using  a  cytocen-  trifuge (Shandon Cytospin 3, Astmoor, UK; 5 min  at  500  rpm),  fixed with  methanol,  and  stained  in  May-Griinwald-Giemsa (Lindholm et  al.,  1991).

Serial  dilutions  were  made in  dimethyl  sulphoxide  (DMSO,  purity  >  99%,  Panreac,  Barcelona,  Spain)  in  sterile  conditions and  50/zl  (1%  v/v)  were  added  to  each  culture.  Negative  and  positive  control  cultures  receiving  50  ~ DMSO  and mytomicin C (MMC, Sigma, St. Louis,  MO,  USA),  respectively, were  also  established  in  parallel.  The  final  concentrations  of  MMC  were  0.4  /zM  for  the  WB  and  0.6  /zM  for  the  IL  cultures The  highest  concentration  of  each  pesticide  was chosen taking into account pH changes, max-  imum solubility in DMSO  and medium, reduction  of  mitotic  index  by  >  50%,  and  general  toxicity  found  in  this  and  previous  studies  conducted  in  our  laboratory (Carbonell  et  al.,  1989; Puig et  al.,  1989; Surrall6s  et  al.,  1990) and  elsewhere (Hoel-  linger  et  al.,  1987; Dolara  et  al.,  1992; Barrueco J.  Surrallds  et al. /  Mutation  Research  341  (1995)  169- et  al.,  1992).  Although  pH  changes  were  not  marked  at the concentrations chosen, doses higher  than  200  /.~g/ml  resulted  in  chemical  precipita-  tion  (Cyp  and  Del)  or  in  complete  lack  of  cell  growth  (Fep,  Fev  and  Per). A  range  of  5 - 6   concentrations  (including  neg-  ative  controls)  of  each  pesticide  was  studied  in  the  WB  cultures  from  the  three  donors.  The  two  highest  effective doses  of each pesticide were  also  tested  in  the  IL  cultures,  with  two  donors. Cell scoring Toxicity was  evaluated  by  classifying  500  cells  according  to  the  number  of  nuclei.  Two  well  known  cytotoxicity indexes were  used:  percentage  of  binucleated  (BN)  cells  (Fenech  and  Morley,  1985)  and  nuclear  division  index  (NDI),  which  was  calculated  following  the  formula:  NDI  =  (MI  +  2MII  +  3MIII  +  4MIV)/total,  where  MI-MIV  represent  the  number  of  cells  with  one  to  four  nuclei  (Eastmond  and  Tucker,  1989).  A  new  in-  dex  for  measuring  cell  proliferation  kinetics  was  also  applied,  which  was  called  cytokinesis  block  proliferation index  (CBPI). This new index is based  on  the  formula:  CBPI  =  MI  +  2MII  +  3  (MIII  +  MIV)/total,  where  MIII  and  MIV  are  equally  considered  to  be  in  their  third  cell  cycle.  While  NDI  is  the  average  number  of  nuclei  per  cell,  CBPI  indicates  the  average  number  of  cell  cycles  undergone  by  a  given  cell,  which  may  be  biologi-  cally  more  relevant  in  the  case  of  cytokinesis-  blocked  cells. The  induction  of MN  was  evaluated  by  scoring  a  total  of  1000  binucleated  (BN)  cells  with  well  preserved  cytoplasm  at  1000 ×  magnification.  BN  cells  were  analyzed  according  to  the  number  of  MN  so  that  total  MN  counts  (MN)  and  total  number  of  micronucleated  BN  cells  (BNMN)  could  be  recorded.  Only  binucleated  cells  were  included  in  the  microscopic  analysis. The  WB  and  IL  experiments  were  done  in  different  laboratories  (Barcelona  and  Helsinki,  respectively) but  using  the  same  pesticide  stocks.  All  scoring was  performed  by the  same  person  on  coded  slides. Statistical analysis The  frequency  of  BNMN  and  MN the  treated  cultures  were  compared  with  their  re- in spective controls by using the  'one  tailed'  Fisher's  exact  test  and  the  Kastenbaum  and  Bowman  (1970)  test,  respectively.  Correlation  coefficients  were calculated by plotting toxicity indexes against  pesticide  concentrations,  and  the  slopes  were  compared  to  zero  using  the  t-test  with  the  null  hyphotesis  considering  that  pesticide  concentra-  tions  and  toxicity indexes  are  not  related.  Corre-  lation  coefficients  derived  from  the  three  differ-  ent  toxicity indexes were  compared  by performing  an  analysis  of variance  (ANOVA). 3.  Results Tables  1-5  show  the  results  obtained  from  the  WB  cultures  with  the  five  pyrethroids  tested  by  using  6 / ~ g / m l   Cyt-B.  Table  6  shows  MN  induc-  tion  by Fen  and  Per  in WB  cultures  of donor  C  at  two concentrations  of Cyt-B. The  results  obtained  with  the  IL  cultures  of  two  donors  with  two  concentrations of the  five insecticides are  summa-  rized  in  Table  7.  None  of  the  five  pyrethroid  tested  was  able  to  induce  a  clear  dose-dependent  increase  of  MN  frequencies,  although  Cyp  ( ~ g / m l )   and  Fep  (10  and  50  ~ g / m l )   produced  a  slight  but  statistically  significant  increase  in  the  frequency  of  MN  and  BNMN  in  WB  cultures  of  two  out  of  the  three  donors.  A  significant  in-  crease  was  also  found  for  Del  (100  and /zg/ml),  both  in  the  WB  and  in  IL,  but  only  in  cultures  of  one  donor  in  each  case.  A  slightly  positive  result  was  likewise  obtained  for  Per  only  at  one  concentration  with  one  donor  in  the  WB  study  and,  therefore,  this  increase  can  be  consid-  ered  as  marginal.  A  possible  suggestion  of  an  effect  was  also  seen  for  Fev  (Tables  4,  6,  and  7)  but  no  statistically  significance  differences  were  obtained.  MMC  showed  a  highly  significant  in-  duction  of MN  with  all  donors  ( P   <  0.001). From cytotoxicity data presented in Tables  1-5,  correlation  coefficients  were  calculated  by  plot-  ting  pesticide  concentrations  against  the  three  toxicity  indexes.  The  results  of  this  analysis  are  shown  in  Table  8.  From  these  correlations,  it  is  obvious  that  the  percentage  of  BN  cells  did  not  reflect  the  reduction  of  cell  proliferation  since  the  correlation  coefficients were  quite  low  and  in

Discussion Initially  considered  to  be  non  hazardous  to  mammals  and  human  health,  pyrethroid  insecti-  cides  were  regarded  as  non-carcinogenic  to  hu-  mans.  Further  studies  of  synthetic  pyrethroids  have,  however,  revealed  a  possible  genotoxic  ac-  tivity  in  a  wide  range  of  organisms.  Most  of  the  pyrethroids were more  recently classified in  group  3  by  IARC  (1991),  since  the  studies  performed  could  not  be  interpreted  as  showing  either  the  presence  or  absence  of  a  carcinogenic  effect,  be-  cause  of  major  qualitative  or  quantitative  limita-  tions.  Therefore,  and  bearing  the  widespread  environmental  occurrence  of  pyre-  throid  insecticides,  the  study  of  their  possible in  mind genotoxicity has  been  of  immediate  concern  dur-  ing  the  last  two  decades. The  data  reported  on  the  genotoxicity of  syn-  thetic  pyrethroids  are  rather  controversial,  de-  pending  on  the  genetic  system  or  the  assay  used.  Mutagenicity  studies  in  bacteria  have  been  per-  formed  for  Cyp,  Del,  Fev  and  Per,  and  they  consistently  gave  negative  results  (Brooks  et  al.,  1976;  Suzuki  et  al.,  1977;  Kavlock  et  al.,  1979;  Pluijmen et al.,  1984; Herrera and  Laborda,  1988).  In  Drosophila melanogaster, the  sex-linked  reces-  sive  lethal  test  was  negative  for  Fep,  Fev,  and  Per,  but  positive  for  Cyp,  while  none  of  these  four  pyrethroids  induced  nondisjunction  (Wood-  ruff  et  al.,  1983;  Batiste-Alentorn  et  al.,  1986,  1987;  Gupta  et  al.,  1990).  Only  Fep  has  been  tested  in  the  somatic  mutation  and  recombination  test  (SMART)  of  D.  melanogaster, with  a  nega-  tive  outcome  (Pardo  et  al.,  1993).  In  plant  meris-  terns,  Cyp  induced  mitotic  abnormalities  in  Vicia  faba  (Amer  and  Aboul-ela,  1985)  and  Del,  chro-  mosome  aberrations  (CA)  in  Allium  cepa (Chau-  han  et  al.,  1986). In  Chinese  hamster  cells  treated  in  vitro,  Fev  intercellular  communication  in  fibro-  inhibited  blasts,  whereas  Del  did  not  (Floodstrom  et  al.,  1988);  Del,  Fev  and  Per were  negative  in  the  hprt  mutation  assay  in  V79  ceils,  but  induced  CA  in

Chinese  hamster  ovary (CHO)  ceils;  Del  and  Fev  also  produced  sister-chromatid  exchanges  (SCE)  in  CHO  cells  (Pluijmen  et  al.,  1984;  Caballo,  1991;  Caballo  et  al.,  1992;  Barrueco  et  al.,  1994).  In  rodents  in  vivo,  Cyp,  Del,  and  Fev  were  reported  to  induce  CA  in  mouse  bone  marrow  ceils  (Bhunya  and  Pati,  1988,  1990;  Pati  and  Bhunya,  1989),  while  one  study  on  Del  yielded  negative results  in the  same  cell system (Polakovfi  and  Vargovfi,  1983).  Fev  caused  CA  also  in  rat  bone  marrow  (Chatterjee  et  al.,  1982)  and  MN  in  polychromatic  erythrocytes  of  mice  (Pati  and  Bhunya,  4989).  Two  studies  on  Cyp  found  induc-  tion  of  MN  in  mice  (Amer  and  Aboul-ela,  1985;  Bhunya  and  Pati,  1988),  although  a  negative  re-  port  has  also  been  published  (Hoellinger  et  al.,  1987).  Both  positive  and  negative  findings  were  likewise  obtained  in  the  mouse  MN  test  for  Del  (Hoellinger  et  al.,  1987;  Bhunya  and  Pati,  1990).  Per  weakly  induced  MN  in  mice  (Hoellinger  et  al.,  1987).  From  the  available  published  data,  it  appears  that  the  genotoxicity of these  pyrethroids seems  not  to  be  modulated  by  animal  metabolic  activation. With  reference  to  carcinogenesis  studies,  Del  and  Fev  were  not  carcinogenic  in  mice  and  rats  (Parker  et  al.,  1983,  1984;  Cabral  et  al.,  1990),  whereas  Fev  showed  a  weak  positivity  in  mice  hepatocytes (Cabral  and  Galendo,  1990). The  findings  of  the  present  study  using  the  CBMN  assay  in  human  lymphocytes  appear  to  suggest  that  pyrethroid  insecticides  have  a  weak  (cypermethrin,  deltamethrin  and  fenpropathrin)  or  nule  (fenvalerate  and  permethrin)  genotoxic  potential  in  vitro.  The  slight  MN  induction  ob-  served  for  Del  in  WB  and  IL  cultures  of  one  donor  appears  to  support  the  weak  in vitro  geno-  toxicity of  Del,  earlier  suggested  by  modest  SCE  induction  in  human  lymphocytes  (Dolara  et  al.,  1992).  Fep  and  Cyp  seemed  to  resemble  Del  in  their  ability  to  weakly  induce  MN.  Fep  has  not  previously  tested  in  cytogenetic  assays  in  vitro,  while  Cyp was  earlier  found  to  be  negative  in  the  SCE  and  CA  test  in  human  lymphocytes (Puig  et

J.  Surrall~s et al. /  Mutation  Research  341  (1995)  169-

al.,  1989).  The  present  findings  disagree  with  previous  results  also  for  Fev which was  not  able  to  significantly increase  MN,  despite  the  former  positive results obtained  using 24  h  shorter  treat-  ment  time  and  3  /~g/ml  Cyt-B  (SurrallEs  et  al.,  1990)  as  well  as  the  induction  of  SCE,  CA  and  C-mitotic  figures  found  in  cultured  human  lym-  phocytes (Puig et al.,  1989; Carbonell et al.,  1989).  The  relatively  clear  MN  induction  described  by  Barrueco  et  al.,  1992  for  Per  using  3  /xg/ml  Cyt-B could not  fully be  confirmed in the present  study  either,  as  a  slight  increase  in  MN  was  obtained  in  a  single  concentration  of Per  in  WB  cultures of one  donor only, using 6 / x g / m l   Cyt-B.  Per  was  earlier  also  shown  to  produce  CA  and,  marginally, SCE in human lymphocytes (Barrueco  et  al.,  1992, 1994).  However,  taking  into  account  that weak genotoxicity is difficult to demonstrate,  especially  if  it  occurs  within  a  narrow  and  toxic  concentration  range,  the  results  obtained  with  Cyp, Del and Fep  are  not necessarily in desagree-  ment  with  those  already  published  in  the  litera-  ture. Several variables  can  affect the  reproducibility  and  the  sensitivity of  the  in  vitro  CBMN  assay,  including methodology, interindividual variability  and  the  source,  chemical composition  and  purity  of the  compound  to  be  tested.  The  methodologi-  cal  aspects  mainly  include  Cyt-B  concentration,  the  presence  or  absence  of  erythrocytes  in  the  lymphocyte  culture  and  treatment  schedule.  In  recent collaborative studies (Surrall6s et al.,  1992,  1994)  we  have  demonstrated  that  the  CBMN  assay  is  reproducible  and  reliable  when  model  genotoxins  are  tested  using  6  ~ g / m l   Cyt-B  and  the methodology applied in the present study. We  showed  that  the  use  of  an  inefficient Cyt-B con-  centration (3  ~ g / m l   Cyt-B) could  lead  to  overes-  timation  of  genetic  damage  possibly  due  to  the  inclusion  in  the  scoring  of  incompletely blocked  binucleated cells  that  have  divided twice  in vitro.  However,  bearing  in  mind  that  both  Cyt-B  con-  centrations  (3  and  6  tzg/ml)  yielded  similar  re-  suits  in  the  present  study,  the  possible  overesti-  mation  of  MN  by  Surrall6s  et  al.  (1990)  and  Barrueco et al. (1992, 1994) does not seem proba-  ble. On  the  other  hand,  the  possible  effect of ery- throcytes can  be  also  excluded  since  both  whole  blood and isolated lymphocyte cultures have been  performed.  Our  results suggest that the presump-  tion of Van Hummelen and Kirsch-Volders (1992)  and  Elhajouji  et  al.  (1993) on  the  superior  sensi-  tivity of IL  cultures  cannot  be  generalized.  With  reference  to  treatment  schedule,  Fev  was  added  24  h  earlier  in  the  present  study  than  in  our  previous  positive  experiments  (Surrall6s  et  al.,  1990).  Barrueco  et  al.  (1992, 1994) added  Per  at  48  h  in  their  CA  studies  and  24  h  (like  in  the  present  study)  for  MN  experiments.  Taking  into  account  that  Fev  and  Per  mainly  induced  chro-  mosome-type aberrations  and were  considered to  act  in  a time-dependent but  S-phase  independent  way (Puig et  al.,  1989; Caballo,  1992; Barrueco  et  al.,  1992, 1994), the  treatment  schedule  used  in  the present  study should be  as sensitive in detect-  ing  a  possible  genotoxicity of  such  chemicals  as  those  described  by  Surrall6s  et  al.  (1990)  and  Barrueco  et  al.  (1992, 1994). Besides  interindividual variability, which could  not be controlled with the number of donors used  in  the  present  study,  other  important  variables  that  could  explain  the  differences found between  the  present  and  earlier  studies  could  be  the  source,  isomer  composition,  or  purity  of  the  in-  secticides  used.  It  is  important  to  point  out  that  the  purity  of  Fev  but  not  Per  was  higher  in  the  present  study  than  in  the  previous  experiments.  The  pyrethroids  used  in  the  present  study  were  obtained  from  Dr.  Ehrenstorfer  GmbH  (Augs-  burg,  Germany) whereas  in  the  previous  studies,  Per  was  obtained  from  Chem.  Service,  (West  Chester,  PA)  and  Fev from S.P.E.  Shell (Madrid,  Spain). Cell  cycle  progression  can  be  delayed  as  a  consequence  of  cellular  toxicity  due  to  in  vitro  treatments.  In order  to control lymphocyte prolif-  eration,  the  percentage  of BN  cells  (Fenech  and  Morley,  1985) and,  more  recently,  nuclear  divi-  sion  index  (NDI,  Eastmond  and  Tucker,  1989)  have  been  used.  The  need  of  including not  only  binucleated  ceils  but  also  multinucleated  cells  was  also  pointed  out  by  Van  Hummelen  and  Kirsch-Volders  (1992)  who  used  the  percentage  of multinucleated cells  as  an  indication of toxicity  or  cell  cycle  delay. The  NDI  reflects  the  average J. Surrall~s et al. /  Mutation Research  341  (1995)  169- number  of  nuclei  per  cell  but  is  an  indirect  indi-  cation  of  cell  cycle  delay  since  it  considers  trinu-  cleated  cells  separately  from  tetranucleated  cells.  We  propose  the  cytokinesis  block  proliferation  index  (CBPI)  in  which  both  trinucleated  and  te-  tranucleated  cells  are  supposed  to  be  in  their  third  cell  cycle.  This  is  acceptable  if it  is  assumed  that  trinucleated  and  tetranucleated  cells  derive  from  binucleated  ceils  undergoing  one  further  mitosis  after  a  multipolar  (tri-  and  tetrapolar  respectively)  anaphase,  as  Schultz  and  0nfelt  (1994)  have  recently  shown  by  video  time-lapse  recording.  Thus,  CBPI  the  average  number  of cell  cycles  the  sampled  cells  have  gone  through,  and  can  be  considered  as  cell  kinetic  index  or  average  lymphocytic  division  index  with  some  similarities  to  the  proliferation  rate  index  (PRI)  used  for  metaphase  in  cultures  treated  with  BrdU. indicates Although  we  found  no  quantitative  differences  in  measuring  cell  cycle  delay  between  N D I   and  CBPI,  CBPI  can  be  considered  biologically  more  relevant  in  measuring  cell  cycle  delay.  Our  results  show  that  CBPI  and  N D I   are  more  effective  in  measuring  cell  cycle  progression  than  the  per-  centage  of  BN  cells  which  is  not  always  reduced  by  toxic  treatments,  because  a  decrease  in  the  number  of  multinucleated  cells  may  not  affect  or  may  even  increase  the  percentage  of  BN  ceils. According  to  our  data,  Fep  appeared  to  be  the  most  toxic  pyrethroid  tested,  as  100  ~ g / m l   re-  suited  in  a  100%  toxicity  in  all  donors  studied.  On  the  other  hand,  Cyp  and  Del  caused  a  similar  reduction  of  cell  proliferation,  and  both  pesti-  cides  were  less  toxic  than  Fev,  which  is  opposite  to  what  was  found  in  our  previous  study  (Puig  et  al.,  1989).  Per  appeared  to  be  as  toxic  as  Fev.  A  relationship  between  the  presence  of  the  cyano  group  and  toxicity  to  mammals  has  been  pro-  posed,  but  the  only  pyrethroid  tested  without  a  cyano  group  (Per)  did  not  produce  higher  toxicity  in  cultured  human  lymphocytes  when  compared  with  the  others.  Therefore,  the  toxicity  of  these  pyrethroids  in  vitro  seems  to  be  more  related  to  the  cyclo-  the  presence  of  methyl  groups  propane  ring  (see  Fig.  1). in I n   c o n c l u s i o n ,   the  five  pyrethroids  tested,  ex-  cept  Fev,  only  weakly  increased  the  frequency  of MN.  Nevertheless,  as  weak  genotoxicity  is  diffi-  cult  to  demonstrate,  more  studies  using  an  ex-  tended  number  of  donors  and  different  culture  schedules  as well  as  different  source,  isomer com-  position  and  purity  of  the  pesticides,  are  re-  quired.  A  clear  linear  dose-dependent  cytotoxic  effect  was  found  with  all  of  the  pesticides  tested;  this  linearity  could  be  accurately  measured  by  means  of  the  newly  introduced  cytokinesis  block  proliferation  index.
