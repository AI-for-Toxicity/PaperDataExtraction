Toxicology Letters 107 (1999) 81– Induction of mitotic cell division disturbances and mitotic arrest by pyrethroids in V79 cell cultures Wolfgang Hadnagy a,*, Norbert H.

The colony forming ability (CFA) resulted in distinct differences of the cytotoxic effect of the tested pyrethroids, whereby permethrin was found to be most toxic. With the exception of fenvalerate all tested pyrethroids gave rise to inhibition of cell cycle progression as shown by G2:M-arrest of synchronized V79 cells by ﬂow cytometry as well as by the increase of the mitotic index as evaluated by light microscopy. The mitotic arresting activity could be attributed to the occurrence of abnormal mitotic ﬁgures such as initial and full C-metaphases. The results however indicate, that pyrethroids per se do not contribute to the cytotoxic effects but that other factors such as chemical impurities, source as well as manufacturing process and isomer composition may be responsible for the observed cytotoxic effects. © 1999 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Hadnagy) the pyrethroids cannot be classiﬁed and are found in group 3 by the International Agency for Re- search on Cancer (IARC, 1991), i.e. there exist no clear indication for or against a carcinogenic ef- fect. Also, based on genotoxicity studies, contro- versial results were obtained. Pyrethroids were found to be negative in bacterial and mammalian mutagenicity test assays (Pluijmen et al., 1994). On the other hand, pyrethroids induced chromo- somal aberrations, sister chromatid exchanges and micronuclei in mammalian cell cultures including 0378-4274:99:$ - see front matter © 1999 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Hadnagy et al. :Toxicology Letters 107 (1999) 81– described exchanges were human cells (Puig et al., 1989; Surralle´s et al., 1990; Barrueco et al., 1992, 1994; Surralle´s et al., in human in vivo studies no 1995). However, induction of chromosomal aberrations or sister chromatid after pyrethroid exposure with the exception that a complex of pesticides including pyrethroids led to the induction of chromosomal aberrations or that mixed exposure of pyrethroids with organophos- phates and carbamates induced micronuclei in human lymphocytes (Pa´ldy et al., 1987; Bolognesi et al., 1993). Based on animal experiments also an increased rate of micronuclei in the bone marrow of the rat and the mouse were found after oral or intravenous application of deltamethrin (Agarwal et al., 1994; Gandhi et al., 1995). These results indicate, that according to a genotoxic potential of pyrethroids the induction of micronuclei might be of considerable concern. Micronuclei result on the one hand from acentric chromosome fragments which are not incorpo- rated into the daughter nuclei during mitotic cell division and on the other hand from whole chro- mosomes that are left behind during mitotic cell division due to mitotic spindle disturbances. The common consequence of both mechanisms is that a small additional nucleus appears in the cyto- plasm of one of the daughter cells which can be detected in the interphase. Therefore, besides a possible clastogenic effect also mitotic spindle dysfunctions must be taken into consideration. Previous studies have demonstrated an inhibition of cell cycle progression in human lymphocyte cultures and the induction of abnormal cell divi- sion in human and plant test assays, which might indicate an effect on the mitotic spindle apparatus very similar to that of the well known spindle poison colchicine (Chauhan et al., 1986; Car- bonell et al., 1989; Surralle´s et al., 1990, 1995). The controversial results of genotoxic effects by induction is prominently means of micronuclei demonstrated by the pyrethroid fenvalerate. Sur- ralle´s et al. (1995) could show that fenvalerate purchased by Ehrenstorfer (Augsburg, Germany) with a chemical purity of 97.9% and tested in the concentration range of 10–100 mg:ml has no ef- fect on cell cycle progression and do not induce in human lymphocyte cultures. On micronuclei the other hand, the same research group described in 1990 a strong inhibition of cell cycle progres- sion and an increased frequency of micronuclei with the same test system using fenvalerate from S.P.E. Shell (Madrid, Spain) which was consid- ered to have a lower chemical purity (Surralle´s et al., 1990). In this study 50 mg:ml fenvalerate ex- hibited an effect equivalent of 2 mg:ml of the cytostatic drug mitomycin C. In addition, Car- bonell et al. (1989), found a strong effect of fenvalerate on the mitotic spindle apparatus re- sulting in the occurrence of so-called C-mitoses, whereby at the highest tested concentration of mg:ml almost exclusively C-mitoses were found which corresponded to an effect equivalent of 0. mg:ml of demecolcin, a potent spindle poison. In accordance with the former study, fenvalerate was also obtained from S.E.P. Shell, however no indi- cation concerning the purity was made. As al- (1995) and ready assumed by Surralle´s et al. shown by the controversial results additional fac- tors such as the source and the purity of the pyrethroids must be taken into consideration with cytotoxic and induction of to the respect genotoxic effects. In order to clarify the controversial ﬁndings, especially the effect on mitotic cell division, we have investigated pyrethroids on their cytotoxic and spindle disturbing effects differing in their chemical purity. 2. Material and methods (99.0%), Pyrethroids, i.e. deltamethrin fenvalerate (99.5% chemical purity), cypermethrin (99.0%, 91.0%) permethrin (97.0%) and cyﬂuthrin (92.0%) were purchased by Ehrenstorfer (Augs- burg, Germany). In addition another cyperme- thrin (99.0%) was obtained from Promochem (Wesel, Germany) All pyrethroids were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and tested in a concentration range of 3.1–100 mg:ml f.c. using Chinese hamster lung cells of line V79. All cell experiments were performed by using Dulbecco’s modiﬁcation of Eagles minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and by incubation at 37°C and 5% CO2 in a humidiﬁed

atmosphere under light protection. The ﬁnal con- centration of DMSO in the cell cultures did not exceed 1%. For cytotoxicity testing the colony forming ability (CFA) test was used in a slightly modiﬁed form as described previously (Hadnagy and See- mayer, 1986). Brieﬂy, 100 logarithmically growing V79 cells per 5 ml were seeded in culture ﬂasks. After 24 h of incubation cultures were treated with the respective pyrethroids at different con- centrations. After incubation for a period of h, treated cultures were washed twice with Hank’s balanced salt solution, incubated for a further h and then ﬁxed and stained with 5% Giemsa. Studies on mitotic arrest was performed by ﬂow cytometry using synchronized V79 cells (Hader et al., 1996) and by evaluation of mitotic index, mitotic proﬁle studies and percentage of abnormal metaphases using light microscopy (Hadnagy et al., 1997). For ﬂow cytometry studies 2.5(cid:29)104 V79 cells: ml medium were cultivated in plastic culture ﬂasks for 50 h. Synchronization was carried out for 16 h by addition of excess of thymidine (2(cid:29) 10(cid:28) 3 M). Cells were blocked in G1:S-phase and started synchronously to grow after elimination of thymidine and addition of desoxycytidine (10(cid:28) M). After 2.5 h cells entered synchronously the G2-phase and thereafter mitosis. At this check point cell cultures were treated with various con- centrations of the pyrethroids and with the known spindle poison colcemid (f.c. 0.1 mg:ml). Duration of treatment lasted for 5.5 h. Then cells were ﬁxed, treated with RNAse and stained with the ﬂuorescence dye DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylin- dole). Flow cytometry was carried out with a PAS II ﬂow cytometer (Partec). Mitotic arresting activ- ity was evaluated from histograms corresponding to counts in the position of G2:M-phase. For light microscopical examination V79 cells were seeded on sterile glass slides placed in plastic dishes (Quadriperm, Heraeus) at a density of 2.5(cid:29) 104 cells:5 ml medium. After incubation for 24 h cells were treated with various concentrations of pyrethroids. Treated cell cultures were further incubated for 16 h (covering 1 cell cycle). Then cells were immediately ﬁxed with methanol-acetic acid (3:1), air dried and thereafter stained with 5% Giemsa in Sørensen buffer (pH 6.8). As a parame- ter of mitotic arresting activity mitotic index was determined by scoring 1000 cells:slide. Normal and abnormal cell division stages were evaluated from 100 mitotic cells:slide. Abnormal mitotic ﬁgures were classiﬁed as initial C-metaphases and full C-metaphases according to Schmid et al. (1989). Initial C-metaphases were characterized by chromosomes dislocated from the metaphase plate and by chromosomes which were arranged in groups or located in the center of the cell exhibiting so-called ball-metaphases. Full C- metaphases were identiﬁed by a complete scatter- ing of contracted chromosomes in the cytoplasma similar to those induced by the known spindle poison colchicine. As an additional important in- dex of mitotic arresting activity the proportion of anaphases plus telophases to metaphases (AT:M ratio) was evaluated. With the exception of the ﬂow cytometry stud- ies, all results are presented as mean values from four replicative experiments. 3. Results and discussion The colony forming ability (CFA) resulted in distinct differences of the cytotoxic effects be- tween the tested pyrethroids (Fig. 1). A dose-de- pendent strong effect was found for permethrin, showing 100% reduction of CFA already at mg:ml as compared to the control. Only moderate effects were found for deltamethrin and fenvaler- ate at the highest tested concentration of mg:ml, whereas CFA of cypermethrin was reduced to 31.3% and cyﬂuthrin to 0%. The described effect on CFA for fenvalerate, delthamethrin, cypermethrin and permethrin is in good agree- ment with another cytotoxic index, the cytokinesis block proliferation index (CBPI) as evaluated in (Surralle´s et al., human lymphocyte cultures 1995). In both of these investigations pyrethroids from the same source (Ehrenstorfer, Augsburg) were used exhibiting similar toxicity in different cytotoxicity test systems and reﬂecting inhibition of cell cycle progression. Reduction of CFA might be the result of mi- totic arrest as could be demonstrated by ﬂow W. Hadnagy et al. :Toxicology Letters 107 (1999) 81– arresting effect of cytometry (Fig. 2). The lowest arrest was found for fenvalerate, the highest arrest for permethrin. the other The mitotic pyrethroids are rather similar and can be found between the effect of fenvalerate and permethrin. Comparing mitotic arresting activity of the spin- dle poison colcemid being about 60% at a concen- mg:ml, tration a concentration of 12.5 mg:ml reached 40%. On the other hand G2:M-arrest of the tested pyrethroids is in good agreement with their cytotoxic activity as shown by CFA. permethrin 0. of at Although cell synchronisation in combination with ﬂow cytometry offers a reliable method for the detection of substances with mitotic arresting activity with advantages as selective treatment of cells in G2:M phase of the cell cycle and higher sensitivity as compared to asynchroneous growing cell culture systems, the only disadvantage is that ﬂow cytometry cannot distinguish between cells in the G2 or M-phase, that means between premi- totic and mitotic cells (Hader et al., 1996). This differentiation is only possible by analyzing cells Fig. 1. Reduction of CFA of V79 cells by different pyrethroids. Fig. 2. G2:M-arrest of synchronized V79 cells by different pyrethroids as measured by ﬂow cytometry. under the light microscope. Therefore, mitotic arresting activity was evaluated by the mitotic index (Fig. 3). With the exception of fenvalerate all tested pyrethroids led to a dose-dependent increase of the mitotic index indicating inhibition of mitosis. From these results it can be concluded that pyrethroids inhibit cell cycle progression dur- ing mitosis by interfering with the mitotic spindle apparatus. This leads to mitotic arrest and as a consequence of the colony forming ability. that also to reduction of In order to know in which stage of the mitosis pyrethroids are active, the evaluation of a mitotic proﬁle is necessary, which is exemplary shown for permethrin in Fig. 4. As can be seen, permethrin leads to a concentration-dependent increase of metaphases, while following mitotic stages as ana- and telophases decrease. That leads to the conclu- sion that the arrest of cells can exclusively be attributed to the metaphase stage which is also clearly demonstrated by the strong reduction of the ratio of ana:telophases to metaphases.

W. Hadnagy et al. :Toxicology Letters 107 (1999) 81–

of to the The arrest at metaphase stage could be at- tributed abnormal occurrence metaphases, such as initial and full C-metaphases (Fig. 5). For permethrin up to 60% abnormal metaphases at the highest tested concentration of 12.5 mg:ml were observed. From these about 80% belonged to the type of initial C-metaphases. Such initial C-metaphases are the result of partial spin- dle disturbances, which might lead to aneuploidy in subsequent cell division. Aneuplody or events that lead to aneuploidy may be of considerable concern with regard to somatic and genetic conse- quences (Hofman et al., 1986; Oshimura and Bar- rett, 1986; Melnick et al., 1996). An interesting point is that the increase of mitotic arrest as shown by ﬂow cytometry and light microscopy is in good agreement with the reduction of the CFA. Therefore, it is assumed that the cytotoxic effect of pyrethroids is associ- ated with the mitotic arresting activity. Interest- ingly, when plotting cytotoxic activity against the degree of impurity a rather good association could be obtained using different pyrethroids (Fig. 6). This might reﬂect an association between Fig. 3. Mitotic index of V79 cell cultures after treatment with different pyrethroids. Fig. 4. Mitotic proﬁle of V79 cell cultures after treatment with permethrin. the degree of chemical impurity of pyrethroids and the reduction of the colony forming ability as well as mitotic arrest. Therefore, it is assumed, that pyrethroids per se do not contribute to the cytotoxic and mitotic arresting activity. The spin- dle disturbing effect might be the result of present impurities of the pyrethroids. Such effects has already been described for other pesticides such as pentachlorphenol (Kerkﬂiet et al., 1982). Whereas the technical grade (86%) pure pentachlorphenol led to depressed T cell cytolysis and enhanced tumor formation in mice, the 99% pure form was without effects. Whether there might be additional factors re- sponsible for cytotoxic and cytogenetic effects, two lots of cypermethrin standards (Ehrenstorfer) differing in their chemical purity (99%, 91%) had been tested by CFA and compared with a cyper- methrin obtained from Promochem declared with a chemical purity of 99% (Fig. 7). Both cyperme- thrin standards from Ehrenstorfer showed differ- ent cytotoxic effects, whereby the cytotoxic effect was distinctly stronger for that cypermethrin with W. Hadnagy et al. :Toxicology Letters 107 (1999) 81– Fig. 5. Percentage of abnormal metaphases in V79 cell cultures after treatment with permethrin. a chemical purity of 91%. This is in good agree- ment with above assumption of an association between the degree of chemical impurities and cytotoxic effects. On the contrary, that cyperme- thrin obtained from Promochem and declared with a chemical purity of 99% showed a similar Fig. 7. Reduction of CFA of V79 cells by cypermethrin. strong cytotoxic effect as the cypermethrin from Ehrenstorfer with only 91% chemical purity. These results indicate that besides the chemical impurities also the source of the pyrethroids seems to be of considerable concern in view of cytotoxic effects and might strongly support the assumption of Surralle´s et al. (1995). Therefore, with of pyrethroids additional factors such as chemical impurities, source as well as manufacturing pro- cess and isomer composition should be taken into consideration. toxicological valuation regard to References Agarwal, D.K., Chauhan, L.K.S., Gupta, S.K., Sundarara- man, V., 1994.
