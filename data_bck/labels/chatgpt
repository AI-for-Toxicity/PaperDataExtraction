Ok chat here's the thing. I need to extract a list of informations from paragraphs of papers in order to build a decent dataset that I can use to fine tune a NLP model that does that automatically.

The list of columns to extract is:
ASSAY_SHORT_DESCRIPTION = short description of the test that has been performed (e.g. "MEA on primary rat cortical neurons")
CHEMICAL = The chemical substance used (e.g. "Deltamethrin")
AOP = Adverse Outcome Pathway (e.g. "Voltage-gated sodium channel modulation → altered network function → behavioral impairment")
EVENT = (e.g "Increased weighted mean firing rate (wMFR) (+24.6%); decreased number of active electrodes (AEs) (-33.5%); changes in network excitability")
AC50 = (e.g.  "38.2 ng/mL")
LOGAC50 = Not to be calculated, just put it there if it's in the paragraph as logac50 instead of just ac50
BMD = (e.g. "BMC50 (most sensitive endpoint): 2.74µM (hNNF, number of spikes per network burst")
MAX_MED_CONC = (e.g. "20µM")
ORGANISM = The organism the test has been performed on (e.g. "rat")
CELL_LINE = (e.g. "Primary cortical neurons")
CELL_FORMAT = (e.g. "monolayer on MEA")
CONCENTRATION = (e.g. "0.027, 0.082, 0.247, 0.74, 2.22, 6.67, 20 µM")
RESPONSE = (e.g. "Concentration-dependent reduction in network parameters (5/14 affected, most sensitive: spikes per network burst, BMC50: 2.74µM)")
CYTOTOX_BURST = Info about cytotoxicity (e.g. "No cytotoxicity at active concentrations")
INTENDED_TARGET = (e.g. "Voltage-gated sodium channels; neuronal and synaptic networks")
BIOLOGICAL_PROCESS_TARGET = (e.g. "Neural network formation, synaptic activity, neuronal firing/bursting, network connectivity/organization")
TISSUE = (e.g. "In vitro model of developing human brain")

In this chat, I will send you paragraphs and you will have to return a JSON or CSV containing all the columns/keys I told you along with found info.
If one or more columns are not found in a paragraph, set the corresponding values to null (json) or nothing (csv).
If in the same paragraph there is data about multiple assays being performed (like the same test being ran on two different substances, output multiple rows).
Do not make up things, just copy-paste informations that are in the paragraph, because I won't be able to train a model to make stuff up instead of extracting informations, so use the same words and values found.
