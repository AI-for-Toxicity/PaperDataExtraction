"001","human NNF (hNNF) assay. A co-culture comprised of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived excitatory and inhibitory neurons as well as primary human astroglia was differentiated for 35 days on microelectrode arrays (MEA), and spontaneous electrical activity, together with cytotoxicity, was assessed on a weekly basis after washout of the compounds 24 h prior to measurements.",,"stressor-specific adverse outcome pathway (AOP) network associated with a plausible molecular initiating event for deltamethrin",,,,,,human,"human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived excitatory and inhibitory neurons; primary human astroglia","co-culture ... differentiated for 35 days on microelectrode arrays (MEA)",,"identifying their DNT potential by evaluation of specific spike-, burst-, and network parameters",,"neural network formation and function (NNF)","key neurodevelopmental processes (KNDP), including the formation and function of neural networks","co-culture comprised of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived excitatory and inhibitory neurons as well as primary human astroglia"
