squalo we have to do something real quick:
I have a file result.json containing a structure like this:

{
  "chunks": [
    {
      "text": "...", 
      "events": []
    },
    {
      "text": "...", 
      "matched_chemicals": ["Bis-I", ... ],
      "matched_species": [ "rabbit", ... ]
      "events": [
        {
          "event_id": 37,
          "chemical": "Bis-I",
          "event_type": "MIE",
          "event_description_short": "Protein kinase C inhibition",
          "score": 77.921,
          "chemical_found": true
        }
      ]
    },
  ],
  "unmatched_events": [
    {
      "event_id": 9,
      "chemical": "β-cyfluthrin",
      "event_type": "KE",
      "event_description_short": "Reduced network synchronicity"
    },
  ]
}

I need to build a small python server that showcases this somehow.
I was thinking of something like a webpage with:
filename (without .json) as the title
a section with the list of events (showing substance, event type, description and score), ordered by score, each will have a reference button that opens the related chunk text (it is quite long, open it as a popup or whatever, the important is that it can be copied)

a section "AOPs" that puts together MIE -> KE -> AO structures for the same substance
it should show each substance that has all the 3 types of events associated
