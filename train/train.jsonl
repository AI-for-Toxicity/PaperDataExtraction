In conclusion, results of the present study suggest that OP (chlorpyrifos) and type II pyrethroid (cypermethrin) compounds are more potentially genotoxic than organochlorinated (endosulfan) and chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbon acid (2,4-D) pesticides at the same concentration. These effects of cypermethrin and chlorpyrifos were observed at the highest concentrations tested. Our findings also suggest that smoking habit of the subject from whom primary lymphocyte cultures were prepared does not influence the direction and level of DNA damage in terms of exposure to cypermethrin and chlorpyrifos. The only different result between smokers and nonsmokers was found in the 2,4-D-treated group.

The most toxic pyrethroid was cypermethrin, followed by permethrin and natural pyrethrin. At 15 𝛍 Mcypermethrin concentration only vague aggregations of cells were seen (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, the total ATP was still about 60% of control at this same concentration (Fig. 3A). At 15 𝛍 M permethrin concentration photographs showed clear changes in cell morphology (Fig. 2C). However, the amount of total ATP at the same concentration was about 95% compared with the controls (Fig. 2A). Also, in natural pyrethrin-exposed cultures signs of toxicity was clearly seen at 15 𝛍 M concentration in microscopic photographs (Fig. 1C). In this concentration the total ATP was close to control levels. Pyrethroid products are widely used in agriculture and households. Although these insecticides cannot be considered highly toxic to mammals, their use indoors in enclosed and poorly ventilated spaces has resulted in some symptoms of toxicity in humans. The main detoxification routes are oxidation and hydrolysis. The hydrolysis of ester bonds by carboxylesterases is the most efficient detoxification route. The pyrethroid esterases localize in the mammalian liver, mainly in the endoplasmic reticulum and are apparently identical with esterases acting on malathion. Non-specific carboxylesterases have been found in tissue homogenates in several species. Pyrethroids are grouped into two subclasses (types I and II) based on chemical structure and the symptoms of acute poisoning produced in animals."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Cytotoxicity (Alamar blue and LDH assay) EC values were determined by fitting a Hill function to DIV12 concentrationresponse plots with parameterization identical to that used for AUC calculations. Selectivity of a compound was defined as the distance from equality of network effect and cytotoxicity EC values (minimum of the 2 cytotoxicity assay EC values used). For selectivity and potency rankings, all compounds with no AUC EC values were excluded and undetermined values were set to the maximum concentration tested (30 m M).

Canozole fungicides have side effects such as endocrine disruption. These compounds exert their endocrine disrupting effects via CYP51 and CYP19 inhibition, which play a significant role as steroidogenic enzymes. Tebuconazole is a widely used fungicide that has a sterol demethylation inhibitor effect. It has been reported that the Tebuconazole plasma half-life is approximately 600 days, and it causes toxic effects on the thyroid, liver, nervous system, and reproductive organs. In addition, it also exposes developmental and genetic toxicity. Chlormequat chloride is a quaternary ammonium compound which is used for floriculture as a plant growth regulator by reducing longitudinal shoot growth effect. Exposure to human beings is quite common. According to WHO, chlormequat is excreted 98% invariably and its acceptable daily intake (ADI) level is 0.05 mg/kg.bw. It is totally eliminated from the body within 46 h. It is important to investigate the potential toxic effects of chlormequat on cellular mechanisms due to the wide range of species that are exposed to it. Organophosphorus pesticides (OP) are the most common pesticide type used worldwide. OPs are absorbed via inhalation, skin, eyes, and ingestion.

As a model organism, zebrafish has been fully sequenced and its genome is highly homologous to the human genome, sharing similar neural and metabolic systems and many physiological traits with human. With these backgrounds mentioned above, we have used computational chemistry methods such as homology modeling, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations (MDs) to theoretically predict and analyse the interaction between pyrethroid pesticides and the zebrafish ER α. Then, on this basis we have carried out bio-assay experiments on zebrafish in order to further determine the binding of the molecules and the protein through the different VTG level of their blood, and to lay a foundation for further understanding of the estrogenic activity and the mechanism of action of pyrethroid pesticides. Protein homology modeling is based on the concept of homologous proteins. Generally speaking, when the template protein is with over 60% homology to target protein, the 3D model we derived is accurate. Once the model is generated, the accuracy of the model can be assessed through Ramachandran plots generated by PROCHECK, ERRAT, VERIFY-3D, etc. Since no crystal structure of zebrafish ER α has been reported in the PDB, the 3D structure of zebrafish ER α was obtained through homology modeling."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Subsequently, MTT solution was removed and DMSO was added to dissolve the purple formazan precipitate formed by activity of mitochondrial enzymes in live cells. The absorbance of formazan product was measured at 540 nm using Multiskan EX microtiter plate reader (Thermo Labsystems, Finland). Cell viability upon incubation with each insecticide was expressed as percentage of viable cells relative to cells treated with DMSO solvent alone which was assigned as 100% viability. The value of 50% lethal concentration (LC 50 ) was evaluated from the plot of percentage of cell viability against different concentrations of each insecticide. Higher LC 50 value represents higher ability to survive toxicity of insecticides. In enzyme inhibition study, cells were coincubated with 100 µM deltamethrin and PBO (known P450 inhibitor) at concentrations of 0.1, 1 and 10 µM (in each case the final concentration of DMSO in media was 1%). This range of PBO concentrations was less than LD50 value (25 µM) of PBO against Sf9 cells pre-determined by MTT assays (data not shown). Inhibition of P450s by PBO was measured as cell survival against deltamethrin cytotoxicity in the presence of PBO, after normalization with that of cells treated with PBO only.

To tackle this issue, Crofton et al. provided a set of 15 principles aiming to enhance assay amenability to higher throughput screening. The establishment of the hNNF assay in this study was realized by considering these principles, which are described in more detail in the following (P1-15). During early brain development, neurons start to mature and build connections via synapses. Neural network formation and function is therefore a key aspect of neurodevelopment (P1 'Key event of neurodevelopment'). By measuring extracellular local field potentials on MEAs, network formation and function can be assessed, thus providing information on electrical activity, firing patterns, and synchronicity of the neural networks (P2 'Endpoint measurement'). By calculating the AUC for each concentration and normalizing the values to the respective solvent control, the hNNF assay can reflect alterations of network activity in both directions (increase and decrease; P3 'Dynamic range'). Furthermore, Crofton et al. emphasize the importance of parametric controls, meaning parameters of the assay that evoke predictable changes in the endpoint (P4 'Parametric controls'). One aspect that was confirmed within the presented study is the increase in electrical activity and synchronicity of the networks with increasing culture time (Fig. 3). Furthermore, Saavedra and colleagues showed that an excitatory:inhibitory (ex:inh) ratio of 70:30 using SynFire neurons exhibits the steadiest spiking increase and coverage of electrodes over differentiation time compared to other ex:inh ratios."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Therefore, and bearing in mind the widespread environmental occurrence of pyrethroid insecticides, the study of their possible genotoxicity has been of immediate concern during the last two decades. The data reported on the genotoxicity of synthetic pyrethroids are rather controversial, depending on the genetic system or the assay used. Mutagenicity studies in bacteria have been performed for Cyp, Del, Fev and Per, and they consistently gave negative results. In Drosophila melanogaster, the sex-linked recessive lethal test was negative for Fep, Fev, and Per, but positive for Cyp, while none of these four pyrethroids induced nondisjunction. Only Fep has been tested in the somatic mutation and recombination test (SMART) of D. melanogaster, with a negative outcome. In plant meristerns, Cyp induced mitotic abnormalities in Vicia faba and Del, chromosome aberrations (CA) in Allium cepa. In Chinese hamster cells treated in vitro, Fev inhibited intercellular communication in fibroblasts, whereas Del did not; Del, Fev and Per were negative in the hprt mutation assay in V79 ceils, but induced CA in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) ceils; Del and Fev also produced sister-chromatid exchanges (SCE) in CHO cells."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Second, total scalar perturbation values (| X |, | X |, | X |, and | X |) were calculated from the system perturbation as the Euclidean norm. This resulted in strictly positive values representative of the total number of standard deviations away from ' normal ' network recordings at each time point. The difference between scalar perturbation values at DIV 5, 7, or 9 and the terminal DIV 12 value were divided by the number of days elapsed to calculate a numerical derivative of change in scalar perturbation over change in time (denoted as V, V, V, and V ). These values were termed ' velocities ' of the system and plotted as individual well velocities over increasing concentration of compound. The velocity over concentration relationship for all replicates was approximated with a localized regression function. The derivative of the velocity with respect to concentration (denoted as ∂ V ) for each compound was then taken to search for a critical concentration at which the slope of velocity changes from negative to positive."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Similarly, our WST-1 test based on the mitochondrial activity showed a considerable reduction of enzyme activities at high concentrations, but at lower concentrations, a clear activation was evident with all pyrethroid compounds studied. In our study, the cell toxicity seem to be dependent on the chemical structure of pyrethroids.

The lowest effect was shown by natural pyrethrin. Other studies have confirmed that pyrethroids without an 𝛂 -cyano group generally show the weakest physiological effect. This dose-dependent cytotoxicity was also shown with microscopic photographing. The higher the molarity of pyrethroid compounds the more morphological damage in the cells appeared.

The relatively clear MN induction described by Barrueco et al., 1992 for Per using 3 /xg/ml Cyt-B could not fully be confirmed in the present study either, as a slight increase in MN was obtained in a single concentration of Per in WB cultures of one donor only, using 6/xg/ml Cyt-B. Per was earlier also shown to produce CA and, marginally, SCE in human lymphocytes. However, taking into account that weak genotoxicity is difficult todemonstrate, especially if it occurs within a narrow and toxic concentration range, the results obtained with Cyp, Del and Fep are not necessarily in desagreement with those already published in the literature. Several variables can affect the reproducibility and the sensitivity of the in vitro CBMN assay, including methodology, interindividual variability and the source, chemical composition and purity of the compound to be tested. The methodological aspects mainly include Cyt-B concentration, the presence or absence of erythrocytes in the lymphocyte culture and treatment schedule.

At DIV 7, spikes (black bars) were the sole form of activity, whereas at DIV 14, bursts (blue bars) started to form on single electrodes. Along with the increase in bursting activity and the emergence of a synchronous network starting on DIV 21, the number of spikes between network bursts decreased at DIV 28 and 35. This transition in network development is reflected by the evaluation of different network parameters of untreated solvent control wells (0.1% DMSO) from all plates contributing to this study (n = 41 plates and 123 wells).

However, recent studies reported that they could have an accumulation effect in human which may cause series of health problems. Estrogen receptors (ER) are a class of nuclear receptors that are vital in proper physiological behavior of estrogens. To investigate the reproductive toxicity of pyrethroids, homology modeling, molecular docking, molecular dynamic simulations (MDs) were conducted to explore the interaction between pyrethroids and ER α from atomic scale. The human ER α (2YJA) was selected as a template protein for homology modeling. Then eight typical pyrethroids and positive control estradiol were docked to the modeled protein. The highest scoring bifenthrin and the lowest scoring permethrin were chosen for in-depth analysis. MDs showed that the complex formed by permethrin with ER α had a lower RMSD value and binding free energies compared to bifenthrin. Based on these results from microscopic dimension, exposure experiments were implemented to validate the primary conclusions. VTG concentrations in male zebrafish ' s blood were significantly higher under permethrin exposure than bifenthrin, suggesting a stronger estrogenic activity and binding propensity. In this regard, the structural characteristics of molecules were analyzed, expecting to provide theoretical references for subsequent drug design and rational drug application."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"bifenthrin\",\"MIE\",\"Less stable ERα complex vs permethrin (MD/MM-PBSA)\"\n\"permethrin\",\"MIE\",\"More stable ERα complex vs bifenthrin (MD/MM-PBSA)\""}]}

Connectivity and coordination of neural networks are key to fundamental cognitive processes such as attention, learning, and memory. An assay that directly measures successful formation of neural networks may therefore be advantageous to identify potential developmental neurotoxicants. To this end, we recently developed an assay for network development based on microelectrode array (MEA) recordings of primary rat cortical neurons over 12days in vitro (DIV). We previously demonstrated proof of concept for this approach by testing 5 compounds chosen for their ability to disrupt normal cortical development and/or network formation and 1 negative control compound. This study demonstrated the assay's ability to discriminate between positive and negative control compounds in at least 16 measures of network activity, identify concentrations at which network failure begins when testing in a concentration-response scheme, and identify selective network perturbations versus nonspecific cytotoxic effects when coupled with terminal cell death assays. Together, these features facilitate chemical prioritization on the basis of potency and selectivity of network developmental effects. The goal of the current study was 2-fold: first, to demonstrate that the throughput of this assay is amenable to screening compounds and second, to evaluate the ability of the assay to detect known neurodevelopmental toxicants on the basis of neural network disruption. Thus, we used this network formation assay to test 86 unique compounds, representing a broad range of DNT mechanisms and possible molecular initiating events."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Surrall6s a, N. Xamena a, A. Creus a, j. Catalfin b, H. Norppa b, R. Marcos a,, throid insecticides are becoming widespread and, therefore, studies on the biological effects of these pesticides are of immediate concern. Numerous studies on their toxicity both in insects and mammals have been reported in the literature. The genotoxicity of these chemicals has been an important research line in our laboratory (Barcelona) during the last 10 years. Although pyrethroid insecticides have consistently shown negative results in microbial genotoxicity tests, the outcome of other assays has been variable and it has not been possible to draw definite conclusions about the genotoxicity of this group of pesticides. The present study deals with the genotoxicity of five synthetic pyrethroid insecticides currently used in modern agriculture in great extent: cypermethrin (Cyp), deltamethrin (Del), fenpropathrin (Fep), fenvalerate (Fev), and permethrin (Per). These chemicals are carboxylic acid esters with three chirial centres located at carbons 1 and 3 of the cyclopropane ring and at the a-carbon of the alcohol moiety. All of them, except permethrin, have a cyano group which has been related to mammalian toxicity (see Fig. 1). The genetic end-point chosen for this study was the micronucleus assay in cultured human iymphocytes. Micronuclei (MN) are acentric chromosome fragments or whole chromosomes that are left behind during mitotic cellular division and appear in the cytoplasm of interphase cells as small additional nuclei."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Cypermethrin\",\"KE\",\"slight micronucleus increase\""}]}

At the same time, bifenthrin and permethrin both had a lower docking score with ER β (see Table S1. ), indicating a selective interaction with ER α. As seen in the docking pattern diagram, for pesticide molecules with different structures, the conformation of their docking into the pocket also differed, thus affecting the degree of binding, which further exhibited the influence of compound structure on properties. To further explore the effect of the binding pattern of the receptor and ligand on the docking scoring results, we selected the highest scoring bifenthrin and the lowest scoring permethrin for analysis. The docking pattern of bifenthrin to the zebrafish ER can be seen in the Fig. 1A, where the entire ligand molecule was deeply bound in the receptor protein in a U-shaped conformation. The carbonyl oxygen on the ester group of the ligand formed a hydrogen bond with the NH on the imidazole group of HIS-217 at a distance of 2.2 Å. In addition, the benzene ring portion of the ligand formed a T-shaped π -π stacking with the benzene ring of PHE-97. The rest of the structure of the ligand was largely surrounded by hydrophobic residues such as MET, ILE, LEU, PHE, ALA, TRP with a few polar residues like GLY, THR, GLU. The ligand was anchored in the protein pocket under hydrophobic interactions.

İstanbul Journal of Pharmacy, 51 (2), 183-190. Background and Aims: Humans and animals have daily contact with various chemicals, including food additives, pesticides, antibiotics, other veterinary drugs, and other xenobiotics. Pesticide exposure causes many health disorders. Mixed exposure to pesticides is an important issue for human and environmental health. Methods: In this study, we have determined the cytotoxicity of chlormequat pirimiphos-methyl, glyphosate, tebuconazole, chlorpyrifos-methyl, deltamethrin, and the mixture of these six pesticides. We further investigated the role of oxidative stress, total oxidant status (TOS), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and antioxidant defense mechanism TOS, total glutathione (GSH) levels with the observed cytotoxicity. Results: In this study, the mixtures of pesticides reduced total antioxidant status (TAS) and GSH level one by one and increased the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in HUVECs, respectively. The results also showed a significant contribution of oxidative stress on cytotoxicity during pesticide mixture exposure. Conclusion: The findings are that pesticide mixture exposure might have an impact on human health risk at contaminated sites and under occupational exposure conditions.

For example, in RTLW1 cells, cytotoxic responses were observed at concentrations above 250mg/L following exposure to technical-grade glyphosate. Although we did not find glyphosate to be cytotoxic, its metabolite AMPA caused cytotoxicity in the gill and liver cells at approximately 500 µ M. Of the eight insecticides we studied, chlorpyrifos and carbaryl yielded EC50 values in all cell lines, with permethrin and chlorantraniliprole yielding selective responses. Permethrin disrupts neuronal function in insects and nontarget organisms by interfering with voltage-gated sodium channels. In the present study, this compound only elicited a response with the membrane integrity endpoint (CFDA-AM) in RTgill-W1 and RTL-W1 cell lines. This is consistent with previous RTgill-W1 cell studies of permethrin in which membrane integrity was a more sensitive endpoint than metabolic activity. Divergent responses were also found for two organophosphate insecticides (chlorpyrifos and diazinon) with a common mechanism of toxicity. In the present study, chlorpyrifos was cytotoxic in all three trout cell lines at concentrations of ≥ 100 µ M, while diazinon was not cytotoxic in any of the cells at concentrations up to 1 mM. Similarly, in a study of human bronchial epithelial (A549) cells and immortalized T-lymphocytes (jurkat) cells, chlorpyrifos was cytotoxic at concentrations of ≥ 250 µ M, but diazinon was not toxic up to 1mM."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"AMPA\",\"KE\",\"cytotoxicity in gill and liver cells\"\n\"chlorpyrifos\",\"KE\",\"cytotoxicity in all three trout cell lines at higher concentrations\"\n\"permethrin\",\"MIE\",\"interference with voltage-gated sodium channels\"\n\"permethrin\",\"KE\",\"membrane integrity loss in gill and liver cells\"\n\"glyphosate\",\"KE\",\"cytotoxicity in RTL-W1 reported in literature at higher concentrations\""}]}

Mepaquat, which was positive in the NVS\\_IC assay for nicotinic receptor binding but did not alter wMFR, along with nicotine and imidacloprid were negative in MEAs in previous studies. There is some evidence that the neurotoxicity of mepiquat involves nicotinic receptors, thus its lack of effects in the MEA assay is consistent with the other nicotinic compounds. While it is possible that the lack of effects of neonicotinoid compounds in the MEAs, which have a lower affinity for mammalian than insect nicotinic receptors, could be the ''true'' response, the lack of effect of nicotine prevents this conclusion from being made with any confidence and indicates that a limitation using wMFR in primary cortical cultures for screening may be a lack of sensitivity to nicotinic compounds. These results are also consistent with the presence of nicotinic receptors, but not cholinergic neurons in primary cortical culture used in these experiments (unpublished data), which suggests that cholinergic input into neuronal networks in this in vitro system may be lacking or have minimal influence on overall network activity.

At the concentration ranges tested, all the five pyrethroids induced clear dose dependent cytotoxic effects, fenpropathrin being the most toxic. Nuclear division index (NDI) and the newly introduced index of cytotoxicity, the cytokinesis block proliferation i dex (CBPI), reflected the dose dependency more accurately than the percentage of binucleated cells did. CBPI is similar to NDI except that it estimates the average number of cell divisions that the cell population has gone through, and, therefore, classifies both trinucleate and tetranucleate cells into the same category. Cypermethrin and fenpropathrin slightly increased the number of MN and micronucleated cells in WB lymphocyte cultures from two out of the three donors. Deltamethrin produced a positive response only in WB cultures of one donor and in IL cultures of another donor. Permethrin gave mostly negative results, although it increased the MN frequency in WB cultures of one donor when 6/~g/ml Cyt-B was used. Fenvalerate did not significantly induce MN.

For compounds that were classified as 'unknowns' in this article, isoniazid, flusilazole, and lactofen might be considered of higher priority for additional testing than TCEP or cotinine. Although only a few examples are cited here, with a much larger number of compounds such an approach would be extremely useful for prioritization. Although it does make sense to prioritize substances with potent and selective effects on network development over those where changes in network function occur concomitantly with changes in viability, nonselective effects should not be dismissed outright. All of the compounds in Figure 4 disrupted network function to some extent; thus inactive compounds are not shown, and the rankings are relative rankings among active compounds. It may be the case for the less potent and/or selective compounds that developing neurons and glia are more susceptible to decreased cell viability than are other tissue types. This hypothesis could be tested by comparison of compound effects on viability in neural versus non-neural cell types. Alternatively, compounds that are nonspecific in the MEA network formation assay may have more specific actions on other key neurodevelopmental processes, such as differentiation or proliferation."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Cypermethrin\",\"KE\",\"Potent and specific disruption of network development\"\n\"Triethyltin bromide\",\"KE\",\"Potent but nonspecific disruption of network development\""}]}

Furthermore, deltamethrin exposure resulted in differential expression of the subunits of VGCC in C. elegans. These results suggest that deltamethrin may induce toxic behavior on C. elegans via regulating the expression of the α 1-subunits of VGCC. Elucidation of the toxic effect of neurotoxic pesticides on the behavior change of C. elegans may advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the toxicity that is induced by these chemicals. Neurotoxic insecticides usually cause locomotion, egg laying and foraging behavior defects in C. elegans when its sensory neurons and nerve conduction are impaired, and cuticule, vulval and pharyngeal muscles are inhibited.

The hiNPCs have the ability to differentiate into neurons and astrocytes in secondary 3D and 3D cultures. For the generation of OLs, however, hiNPC differentiation time takes at least 8 weeks and is therefore not directly comparable to the primary neurospheres which produce OLs within 5 days of differentiation. Here we present data on hiNPC proliferation, migration and the differentiation potential. When relating hiNPC ( Figure 7A ) to hNPC neurospheres ( Figure 2A ), they display the same neurosphere morphology and cannot be distinguished from each other with the bare eye. Moreover, hiNPCs express the neural stem/progenitor markers nestin and SOX2 ( Figure 7D ). The percentage of Nestin/ SOX2 double-positive hiNPCs (70.8%) was in the same ballpark as that of hNPC (76.6%). Human iNPCs contained 10.6% cells not expressing any of the two markers, which is higher compared to the average of 1.9% of the three hNPC individuals ( Figure 2 ). The proliferative capacity of hiNPCs was confirmed by measuring the sphere size increase over 3 days (iNPC1a) as shown in Figure 7B. hiNPC neurospheres increased their size by 53.6% during the 3 days in a proliferation medium containing EGF and FGF basic (control), whereas hiNPCs cultivated in proliferation media without growth factors (w/o growth factors) did not increase in size."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Cell toxicity was evaluated by determining the total ATP with a luminescent method and by determining the mitochondrial activity with WST-1 method. The in vitro exposure of neuroblastoma cells to the test compounds lasted for 24 h. In addition, we evaluated cellular changes due to the exposures by microscopic photographing of cell cultures. 3.1. Cell toxicity obtained with ATP and WST-1 methods Exposure to 0.1-100 𝛍 M of pyrethrin, permethrin, and cypermethrin compounds showed dose-dependent cytotoxicity. The results obtained with WST-1 method and with the measurement of total ATP were different. ATP measurement seemed to show cytotoxicity at lower concentrations than WST-1 method. Actually, there was a clear induction of enzyme activities with WST-1 test with all pyrethroid compounds studied when the concentrations were not overly toxic (Figs. 1B,2B, and3B). The most toxic pyrethroid was cypermethrin, (Ripcord, Fig. 3), followed by permethrin, (Biokill, Fig. 2), and natural pyrethrin (Biospray S, Fig. 1). The detectable toxicity of cypermethrin started at 1 𝛍 M concentration, and at 15 𝛍 M concentration the total ATP was markedly decreased, to 61% of control.

The Bdnf eIV-IX mRNA expression induced by ethynyl derivatives The inducibility of Bdnf eIV-IX mRNA expression in cultured rat cortical neurons was evaluated using real-time RT-PCR with all the derivatives synthesized here. Initially, we monitored the level of Bdnf eIV-IX mRNA expression induced by the parental ethynyl derivative, 2a. As shown in Figure 2, the expression of Bdnf eIV-IX mRNA was increased by addition of 2a. While the optimum concentration of DM was 1 l M, the maximum induction by 2a was obtained at 10 l M (Fig. 2A), indicating that the inductive activity of 2a is less than one tenth lower than that of DM. A time-dependent increase in Bdnf eIV-IX mRNA expression was observed until 3 h after starting the incubation but declined at 6 h (Fig. 2B(a)). However, the increased level of expression seen at 3 h returned at 12 h and was maintained until 24 h (Fig. 2B(b)).

Carbamates are considered reversible AChE inhibitors and OPs as irreversible AChE inhibitors. OPs are able to phosphorylate serine residues of AChE in non-reversible way, whereas the carbamylated serine residue is less stable and the carbamyl moiety can be split from the enzyme by spontaneous hydrolysis. We have earlier reported antagonistic effects of the binary combination of OPs (CPF + PRF, CPF + MLT, MCP + MLT, PRF + MLT, MLT + TRZ and PRF + TRZ) under oxidised conditions. This was explained on the basis of dispositional and/ or receptor antagonism. We also reported synergistic responses for the majority of the OP binary combinations assayed under unoxidised conditions. Triazophos showed very strong synergism in binary combinations with CPF, MCP and PRF under un-oxidised conditions. In the present study, TRZ showed synergistic effects with CBF and CRB. Laetz et al. observed both concentration additivity and synergism in the binary combinations of carbamates and organophosphates tested, with a greater degree of synergism at higher exposure concentrations. However, the comparison between in vivo and in vitro results should be used with caution and care should be taken when extrapolating among taxonomic groups.

Of the 10 chemicals that may act on this receptor, 9 of them disrupted at least 1 parameter of network development, and 6/9 were selective in their actions on network parameters (chlordane, mirex, and endosulfan were not). Voltage-gated sodium channels are also well established pharmaceutical and insecticidal targets and 20/21 unique chemicals with actions on this channel disrupted network development, with 18 of those chemicals acting in a selective manner.

Glyphosate exposure causes toxic effects in mammalians by increasing oxidative stress levels. Due to its common usage, this pesticide residue can be found in food and environmental samples. The main toxicity mechanism of glyphosate increases the emergence of ROS and causes disruption on cellular macromolecules by ROS. Chlorpyrifos is another widely used broad-spectrum organophosphorus insecticide. It has been reported that chlorpyrifos might have some toxic effects on organs and systems. Its common toxic effect is on the nervous system by acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition. Its main toxic effect mechanism is associated with cellular oxidative stress increment. Deltamethrin is part of the potent pyrethroid class of insecticides and acaricides. Also, deltamethrin has been used for controlling human diseases caused by mosquitos that are vectors of Zika virus and Dengue virus. It has been reported that deltamethrin exerts its toxic effects by increasing cellular ROS and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Oxidative stress remarkably increases the deltamethrin toxicity mechanism.

As can be seen, permethrin leads to a concentration-dependent increase of metaphases, while following mitotic stages as anaand telophases decrease. That leads to the conclusion that the arrest of cells can exclusively be attributed to the metaphase stage which is also clearly demonstrated by the strong reduction of the ratio of ana: telophases to metaphases. The arrest at metaphase stage could be attributed to the occurrence of abnormal metaphases, such as initial and full C-metaphases (Fig. 5). For permethrin up to 60% abnormal metaphases at the highest tested concentration of 12.5 m g: ml were observed. From these about 80% belonged to the type of initial C-metaphases. Such initial C-metaphases are the result of partial spindle disturbances, which might lead to aneuploidy in subsequent cell division. Aneuplody or events that lead to aneuploidy may be of considerable concern with regard to somatic and genetic consequences. An interesting point is that the increase of mitotic arrest as shown by flow cytometry and light microscopy is in good agreement with the reduction of the CFA. Therefore, it is assumed that the cytotoxic effect of pyrethroids is associated with the mitotic arresting activity. Interestingly, when plotting cytotoxic activity against the degree of impurity a rather good association could be obtained using different pyrethroids (Fig. 6)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Permethrin\",\"KE\",\"metaphase arrest\"\n\"Permethrin\",\"AO\",\"aneuploidy potential\""}]}

Studies on EGFR knockout mice reported a decrease in brain size, supporting the involvement of the EGFR in migratory processes during cortical development. Moreover, intraventricular administration of EGF caused migration of subependymal NPCs from the lateral ventricle into the adjacent neural tissue in the adult mouse brain. Similarly, exposure to EGF (0.5 -1 ng/ml) after neurosphere plating enhanced hNPC migration compared to the solvent control ( Figure 3C ). In addition, co-administration of the EGFR-inhibitor PD153035 (1 -2 µM) antagonized the EGFinduced migratory stimulating effect demonstrating EGF action on NPC migration via the EGFR. As a second human-relevant key regulator of migration, which is expressed in hNPCs, we assessed the effects of SRCfamily kinase inhibition on RG migration. SRC-family kinases are fundamental for brain development and disruption of their activity correlates with defects in radial migration and reelerlike malformations of cortical development. Exposure of migrating hNPCs to the SRC-family kinase inhibitor PP2 reduced hNPC migration to 40% of the solvent control without causing any signs of cytotoxicity.

This might substantially help to extrapolate from rat in vivo studies to humans using the parallelogram approach. 4.3 Use of hNNF data on deltamethrin for the development of a putative AOP In 2021, the EFSA developed an IATA case study with the goal of including all available in vivo and in vitro data, among others the data generated within the DNT IVB for DNT hazard identification for the Type II pyrethroid insecticide deltamethrin. Epidemiological studies revealed associations between childhood exposure to pyrethroids like deltamethrin and neurodevelopmental disorders, e.g., attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or autism spectrum disorder. As previously shown, deltamethrin negatively influenced 5 of 14 parameters describing network function with 'Number of spikes per network burst' as the most sensitive endpoint within the hNNF assay (BMC50 2.7 µM)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"deltamethrin\",\"KE\",\"Altered neural network function\"\n\"deltamethrin\",\"AO\",\"Neurodevelopmental disorders (association)\""}]}

Westerink 1 Neurotoxicology Research Group, Toxicology Division, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences (IRAS), Utrecht University, NL-3508 TD Utrecht, The Netherlands Wepreviously demonstrated that acute inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) is a common mode of action for (sub)micromolar concentrations of chemicals, including insecticides. However, because human exposure to chemicals is usually chronic and repeated, we investigated if selected insecticides from different chemical classes (organochlorines, organophosphates, pyrethroids, carbamates, and neonicotinoids) also disturb calcium homeostasis after subchronic (24h) exposure and after a subsequent (repeated) acute exposure. Effects on calcium homeostasis were investigated with singlecell fluorescence (Fura-2) imaging of PC12 cells. Cells were depolarized with high-K saline to study effects of subchronic or repeated exposure on VGCC-mediated Ca influx. The results demonstrate that except for carbaryl and imidacloprid, all selected insecticides inhibited depolarization (K )-evoked Ca influx after subchronic exposure (IC 's: approximately 1-10 m M) in PC12 cells. These inhibitory effects were not or only slowly reversible. Moreover, repeated exposure augmented the inhibition of the K -evoked increase in intracellular calcium concentration induced by subchronic exposure to cypermethrin, chlorpyrifos, chlorpyrifos-oxon, and endosulfan (IC 's: approximately 0.1-4 m M). In rat primary cortical cultures, acute and repeated chlorpyrifos exposure also augmented inhibition of VGCCs compared with subchronic exposure."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"endosulfan\",\"MIE\",\"Inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs)\"\n\"chlorpyrifos\",\"MIE\",\"Inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs)\"\n\"chlorpyrifos-oxon\",\"MIE\",\"Inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs)\"\n\"cypermethrin\",\"MIE\",\"Inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs)\"\n\"chlorpyrifos\",\"KE\",\"Augmented inhibition of VGCCs after repeated exposure compared with subchronic exposure\"\n\"chlorpyrifos-oxon\",\"KE\",\"Augmented inhibition of VGCCs after repeated exposure compared with subchronic exposure\"\n\"cypermethrin\",\"KE\",\"Augmented inhibition of VGCCs after repeated exposure compared with subchronic exposure\"\n\"carbaryl\",\"KE\",\"No significant inhibition of K+-evoked Ca2+ influx after subchronic exposure\"\n\"imidacloprid\",\"KE\",\"No significant inhibition of K+-evoked Ca2+ influx after subchronic exposure\""}]}

The common consequence of both mechanisms is that a small additional nucleus appears in the cytoplasm of one of the daughter cells which can be detected in the interphase. Therefore, besides a possible clastogenic effect also mitotic spindle dysfunctions must be taken into consideration. Previous studies have demonstrated an inhibition of cell cycle progression in human lymphocyte cultures and the induction of abnormal cell division in human and plant test assays, which might indicate an effect on the mitotic spindle apparatus very similar to that of the well known spindle poison colchicine. The controversial results of genotoxic effects by means of micronuclei induction is prominently demonstrated by the pyrethroid fenvalerate. Surralle ´s et al. could show that fenvalerate purchased by Ehrenstorfer (Augsburg, Germany) with a chemical purity of 97.9% and tested in the concentration range of 10-100 m g: ml has no effect on cell cycle progression and do not induce micronuclei in human lymphocyte cultures. On the other hand, the same research group described in 1990 a strong inhibition of cell cycle progression and an increased frequency of micronuclei with the same test system using fenvalerate from S.P.E.

However, important data were not available for all of the test compounds. Never the less, based on this small sample, calculated tipping points indicate effects at relevant doses in vivo. Several caveats should be noted regarding this analysis. First, the in vivo dose levels were simply those reported in the literature as cited in Mundy et al., 2015; these were not LOAEL values from guideline studies. Thus, it may be that other events or endpoints are more sensitive to perturbation than those examined here, either in vivo or in vitro. Second, the httk model predictions in some cases (for example the mouse data) relied on substitution of data from another species (human), as species-specific data were not available, or on other assumptions, for example, regarding chemical binding to protein. Third, it should be noted that a relationship between the in vitro alternations of network development and the in vivo endpoint reported in the studies used is not implied by these comparisons, simply that dose/ concentration levels are concordant. In the future, such associations could be strengthened by linking the in vitro effects, through a series of key events, to an adverse neurodevelopmental outcome ( e.g. through an adverse outcome pathway or AOP)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Yet the EGF effects on hiNPC migration were weaker than in primary hNPCs (122% compared to 130% (0.5 ng/ml EGF) and 127% compared to 143% (1 ng/ml EGF)). This might be due to the developmental timing since the density of EGFR increases processivity through brain development. Hence, the reduced responsiveness of hiNPCs to EGFR signaling could indicate that hiNPCs represent an earlier developmental time point compared to fetal hNPCs. However, since the observed differences were minor, additional studies are needed to thoroughly compare EGF function on hNPC and hiNPC migration. Further important regulators of neurodevelopmental migratory processes are SRC-kinases. Treatment of differentiating hiNPCs with the SRC-kinase inhibitor PP2 for 72 h reduced the migration distance to 51% of the respective solvent control without inducing any signs of cytotoxicity ( Figure 8D ). This is comparable to the hNPC response to PP2 exposure ( Figure 3D ). Last, we studied the effects of the RhoA GTPase activator narciclasine on hiNPC migration. RhoA activation reduced hiNPC migration in a concentration-dependent manner ( Figure 8E ). Comparing the hiNPC results ( Figure 8E ) to the response of primary hNPCs to narciclasine exposure, the two cell systems did not differ in sensitivity (BMR 0.010 and 0.018 µM, respectively)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"PP2\",\"KE\",\"reduced cell migration\"\n\"narciclasine\",\"KE\",\"reduced hiNPC migration\"\n\"EGF\",\"KE\",\"increased migration\""}]}

Sensitivity of insect Sf9 cells to cytotoxic effects of compounds such as fungal metabolites, pyridalyl insecticide have been reported. Thus susceptibility of Sf9 parental cells to insecticide cytotoxicity observed in the present study is advantageous to determining capability of P450 enzymes in detoxifying insecticides. Capability of P450 in detoxifying cytotoxic xenochemicals were previously reported using insect cells expressing P450 enzyme via baculovirusdirected expression. Moreover Sf21 cells expressing human CYP1A1 were used to investigate toxicity of naphthalene. The results of this study revealed that CYP6P7 and CYP6AA3 could function in metabolizing of permethrin, cypermethrin, and deltamethrin, however role in metabolisms of bioallethrin, chlorpyrifos and propoxur was not observed. Thus abilities of CYP6P7 and CYP6AA3 in detoxifying pyrethroids support their role in conferring deltamethrin resistance in An. minimus mosquito. A difference was noted in that while CYP6AA3 showed metabolic activity and cytoprotective activity against λ -cyhalothrin, these capabilities were not observed for CYP6P7. The results thus indicated differences in properties of these two enzymes.

Current guideline DNT studies are resource intensive and not amenable to screening large numbers of compounds for hazard. As part of evaluating a battery of more rapid and scalable in vitro assays for DNT hazard, 86 compounds were screened for their ability to alter function during cortical network development. Developing rat cortical networks were treated with a concentration series (usually 0.03-30 m M) of 86 compounds, 60 of which have known in vivo DNT effects ('DNT Reference Set'). Spontaneous network activity was monitored by microelectrode array recordings over 12days in vitro, and 17 measures of network activity and synchrony were quantified. Following recordings on days in vitro 12, in-well cell assessment of metabolic activity (Alamar blue) and total cellular content (lactase dehydrogenase) were conducted.

In comparison, CNQX primarily antagonizes AMPA-type glutamate receptors and thereby suppresses spontaneous excitatory glutamatergic synaptic activity. After baseline recording at DIV 21, cells were exposed to the respective modulator, and the electrical activity was measured. Exposure to 3 µM BIC increased general electrical activity, especially synchronous bursting (Fig. 3A, pink boxes), whereas 30 µM CNQX led to a loss of organized activity, as illustrated by representative 100-s spike raster plots (Fig. 3A,B). For additional quality control of the test method, acute treatments with the two described modulators were included in every assay run. Violin plots for each compound and four different network parameters (Fig. 3C-F) illustrate the distribution of these data, and the median of 8-9 independent experiments (median of 3 technical replicates each) reveals the effect of both receptor antagonists. 3 µM BIC significantly enhanced the mean firing rate and burst duration. Consistent with the spike raster plots, BIC doubled the percentage of overall spikes contributing to network bursts from 40% to 80% ('Network burst percentage', Fig. 3E) and increased the area under normalized cross-correlation ('AUNCC', Fig. 3F), which describes the synchronicity of the network. In contrast, CNQX inhibited the overall activity and organization of the networks. Especially burst duration and synchronicity were impaired with a low degree of variation (Fig. 3H,J).

Thus, the lack of effect of nicotine in the present study may be due to the concentration being too low to elicit an effect. However, the efficacy of nicotine on neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in primary hippocampal cultures is in the range of /C24 10-25 m M, much lower than the concentrations used in either MEA study. The effects reported by Defranchi and co-workers may not have been mediated by nAChR, which was not tested in that study. Alternatively, it is possible that the culture model used here is not responsive to nicotinic modulation, and the lack of response to nicotine in the present study reflects this. Imidacloprid has a lower affinity for some subtypes of nAChR than nicotine and can function under some conditions as a partial agonist. Given the lack of response to nicotine in the present study, it is not surprising that imidacloprid did not alter network activity. Compared to the two nicotinic agonists, it is interesting that two cholinesterase inhibiting insecticides, chlorpyrifos oxon and carbaryl, caused clear effects in the present study. Carbaryl also produced complete inhibition of MFR in studies by Defranchi and colleagues. These results are consistent with previous reports of alterations in spontaneous activity of neural networks by cholinesterase inhibitors."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Nicotine\",\"MIE\",\"nAChR agonist\"\n\"Imidacloprid\",\"MIE\",\"nAChR pesticide\""}]}

As BDNF has neurotrophic activity, it seems highly possible that endogenously synthesized BDNF, whose production could be stimulated by DM, is responsible for the neurotrophic effect of DM through the secretion of BDNF. In support of this notion, prior addition of TrkB/Fc reduced the increases in neurite complexity and length induced by DM. Next, we investigated how the neurotrophic effect of DM is controlled in neurons. By using Bay K8644 or BAPTA-AM, we confirmed that extracellular and intracellular Ca 2 þ are essentially required for the increase in DM-induced Bdnf eIV-IX mRNA expression. The simultaneous addition of Bay K8644 with DM markedly enhanced the Bdnf eIV-IX mRNA expression, compared to the increase induced by Bay K8644 only. This effect of combined DM þ Bay K8644 is likely due to an easier accessibility of Bay K8644 to sites within L-VDCC molecule, which could be induced by depolarization via the action of DM on VSSC. The same effect of BAPTA-AM or Bay K8644 was detected on the DM-induced activation of Bdnf-pIV, indicating that the increase in Bdnf eIV-IX mRNA expression induced by DM is controlled at the transcriptional level.

Indeed, there is a body of evidence that indicates changes in the rate of neurodevelopment alter functional outcomes. It will be important for future studies to challenge these recovered neural networks to examine the lasting impact of developmental exposures. It should be pointed out that the assay as performed does not attempt to 'wash out' compounds prior to assessment. Thus, the possibility cannot be discounted that some of the False positive rate observed effects are due to acute actions of the compounds on network activity at the time of measurement, as opposed to a developmental effect on network formation. From the standpoint of a screening approach, making such a distinction is, in our opinion, of lower priority than determining alterations in activity for several reasons. First, the data suggest that for a number of compounds, the effects following exposure during network development are different than acute effects. This includes lindane and dieldrin, which increased MFR following acute exposure but here decreased MFR over the 12-day exposure period. For TPHP and TTDCIPP, decreases in MFR (IC values of approximately 16 l M) were reported by Behl et al. However, in the present study, IC values for MFR were not able to be determined for these compounds, and other parameters were altered at approximately 9 and 0.09 l M, respectively."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"TPHP\",\"KE\",\"Altered network parameters during development\"\n\"TDCIPP\",\"KE\",\"Altered network parameters during development\"\n\"Lindane\",\"KE\",\"Decreased mean firing rate over developmental exposure\"\n\"Dieldrin\",\"KE\",\"Decreased mean firing rate over developmental exposure\""}]}

Taken together these observations suggest that deltamethrin and carbofuran might have a similar mechanism of action. However, the deltamethrin treated worms showed no hyper-contraction. Carbofuran is an anticholinesterase. In the presence of carbofuran, acetylcholine accumulates in the synaptic cleft as a result of the inability of acetylcholinesterase to break down acetylcholine. This build-up of acetylcholine leads to over-activation of cholinergic receptors, muscle hyper-contraction, paralysis, and eventually cell death. Thus, deltamethrin and carbofuran showed the difference on body length, indicating the profile of actions of deltamethrin in C. elegans is distinct from carbofuran. While some studies have shown that the above behaviors are controlled by multiple factors. For example, the hermaphrodite-specific neurons (HSNs) control 16 egg-laying muscles via electrical connection between the vulval and the uterine muscles, although the HSNs make synapses directly only onto the vulval muscles. Foraging is a rapid, side-to-side movement of the nose generated by C. elegans as it explores its environment. Several neurons, including odorant-sensing AWA and AWC neurons, the OLQ and IL1 sensory neurons and the RMGmotor neurons, have been shown to be required for this behavior. Pharyngeal neurons MC, M2, M4, and I1 form multiple direct and indirect excitatory pathways in a robust network for control of pharyngeal pumping. Therefore, whether deltamethrin is toxic to these neurons needs further investigation."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"carbofuran\",\"KE\",\"Over-activation of cholinergic receptors\"\n\"carbofuran\",\"KE\",\"Muscle hyper-contraction and paralysis\"\n\"carbofuran\",\"MIE\",\"Anticholinesterase action and acetylcholinesterase inhibition\"\n\"carbofuran\",\"AO\",\"Cell death following cholinergic overstimulation\""}]}

Metabolic changes from exposure of rats to different pesticides has been recorded by previous studies, although in some cases, such as permethrin exposure, the observed metabolic responses were not consistent. Liang et al. reported an increase in free amino acids in the serum of rats following long -term (60 days) exposure to permethrin. A separate study comparing the response from multiple classes of pesticide chemicals found that there was no substantial change in amino acids in rats treated with a high dose of permethrin for 2 hours. In this study, the response of amino acids to permethrin exposure was varied, with some increasing and others decreasing (Figure 4 and Table S1), indicating that there is some response to the pesticide exposure, but that it is not a one -way effect. The response of amino acids may be indicative of other energy metabolism processes (e.g. glycolysis or fatty acid β -oxidation) being the focus of toxic effects, and that altered usage or production of amino acids is an indirect effect. For example, this study observed that permethrin exposure had a predominantly increased fatty acid -based response in the metabolome.

Assay results were reproducible; 10 chemicals tested as biological replicates yielded qualitative results that were 100% concordant, with consistent potency values.

Tipping points are one method for determining the adaptive vs adverse responses, and in the present case, the tipping points represent the concentration at which development of network function no longer proceeds according to its normal trajectory in vitro. Although speculative, an additional point to consider in the present study is whether or not the ' adaptive ' responses just below the tipping points (concentrations at which ' recovery ' is observed), might also ultimately lead to adverse responses. The importance of electrical activity in development of the nervous system is well established. Further, the timing of electrical activity during nervous system development is also crucial, and delays in electrical activity have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as attention-deficit hyper activity syndrome. Thus, the possibility exists that even in cases where some recovery of network activity to normal response levels occurs, the excursion out of normal parameters may disrupt the timing of other important event sequences, resulting in latent or delayed effects on nervous system function. Such effects may only become apparent later in life or only when the nervous system is challenged in a way that uncovers the deficit.

However, the metabolomic analysis identified cell-to-cell signaling and interaction, amino acid metabolism, drug metabolism, and molecular transport. When transcriptomic and metabolomic information were combined, this analysis identified cellular development, cellular movement, cellular growth and proliferation, cell morphology, and cell death and survival as molecular and cellular pathways altered by CA. The cellular and molecular functions and disease categories that were associated with treatment for the remaining 5 compounds had a high degree of overlap (Figure 4) with those identified for CA. In the combined analysis, cell-to-cell signaling and interaction was identified for 4 compounds (CM, DM, HP, and DA), while cell morphology (CA, CM, and DM), cell death and survival (CA, 5FU, and CM), and cell function and maintenance (5FU, DM, and HP) were each associated with 3 compounds."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

To quantify the structural changes, we performed a Sholl analysis, enabling us to detect changes in neurite complexity by measuring the number of crossings between neurites and circles with different diameters. As shown in Fig. 2A, B, and C, addition of DM increased the number of crossings in cultures harvested 6 h after the incubation, indicating that DM promotes neurite complexity. We also measured total length of neurites using Image J software and found that DM increased the length of neurites (Fig. 2D). Since DM increases neuronal excitability through its effect on VSSC that depolarizes the membrane and subsequently openings of L-VDCC that cause the influxof Ca 2 þ into neurons, we examined the effect of blockade of Ca influx via L-VDCC or activation of GABA receptors on the DM-induced increase in neurite complexity and length.

In particular, the methyl derivative 2e exhibited greater potency at 10 l M than 2a. Based on these observations, a substituent containing a triple bond at the a -position effectively induces the expression of Bdnf mRNA, with the cyano group having the greatest effect. In addition, the size of the substituent at the terminal of the ethynyl group affects the action toward sodium channels, resulting in the difference in the levels of Bdnf eIV-IX mRNA expression among the derivatives. 2.2.3.

The scoring results are shown in Table 1, and the docking pattern is plotted in Fig. S7. The scoring module uses four empirical scoring functions to evaluate the binding of the receptor to the ligand from different perspectives such as polar interaction, hydrophobic entropy and solvation. A total score is obtained by aggregating each function, which indicates the affinity of the ligand to the receptor. Typically, a Total score greater than 4 is regarded as a valid docking of the ligand to the receptor. Crash indicates the extent to which the ligand penetrates the protein preferably close to 0. Polar indicates the ability of an atom to form a hydrogen bond where a positive value means a strong hydrogen bonding ability and vice versa. The positive compound estradiol received the highest score, which was consistent with the objective fact, indicating that the docking result was relatively reliable.

Although cell synchronisation in combination with flow cytometry offers a reliable method for the detection of substances with mitotic arresting activity with advantages as selective treatment of cells in G2: M phase of the cell cycle and higher sensitivity as compared to asynchroneous growing cell culture systems, the only disadvantage is that flow cytometry cannot distinguish between cells in the G2 or M-phase, that means between premitotic and mitotic cells. This differentiation is only possible by analyzing cells under the light microscope. Therefore, mitotic arresting activity was evaluated by the mitotic index (Fig. 3). With the exception of fenvalerate all tested pyrethroids led to a dose-dependent increase of the mitotic index indicating inhibition of mitosis. From these results it can be concluded that pyrethroids inhibit cell cycle progression during mitosis by interfering with the mitotic spindle apparatus.

Anticholinesterase insecticides such as organophosphorous (OP) and carbamates pesticides (CB); and synthetic pyrethroids (SP) pesticides commonly co-occur in the environment. This raises the possibility of antagonistic, additive, or synergistic neurotoxicity in exposed organisms. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition has been demonstrated to be useful as a biomarker for exposure to OP and CBs in many environments. This study investigated the response of housefly ( Musca domestica ) head AChE (HF-AChE) exposed tofive OPs; chlorpyrifos (CPF), malathion (MLT), triazophos (TRZ), monocrotophos (MCP) and profenofos (PRF) and two CBs; carbaryl (CRB) and carbofuran (CBF) as individual compounds and as binary mixtures of OPs and CBs under in vitro conditions."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"monocrotophos\",\"KE\",\"synergism with carbaryl and carbofuran\"\n\"chlorpyrifos\",\"KE\",\"synergistic AChE inhibition in mixtures with carbamates\"\n\"carbofuran\",\"KE\",\"synergism with profenofos under oxidation\""}]}

Consistent with the above-mentioned effect of RhoA activation on neuronal differentiation (NPC3), narciclasine also reduced both neurite area and neurite length ( Figure 4I adapted from Masjosthusmann et al. ) within the NPC4 assay. This is in line with previous studies, reporting that narciclasine reduced neurite outgrowth via the Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) pathway in neurons differentiated from LUHMES human neuronal precursor cells. Moreover, a contactin-1 knock-down-dependent increase in RhoA activity caused morphological alterations in rat cortical neurons in vivo. Neurite outgrowth is further regulated by protein kinase C (PKC), a serine/threonine kinase, which controls various cellular responses by phosphorylation of substrate molecules and alteration of gene transcription. While PKC activation induced neurite outgrowth in rat pheochromocytoma (PC-12) cells and primary rat spinal cord neurons from embryonic day 14, inhibition of PKC with the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide 1 (Bis-I) reduced neurite growth in PC-12 cells, rat cortical neurons and human iPSCderived neurons. Similar effects were identified in the NPC4 assay upon exposure of hNPCs to Bis-I, which reduced neurite length and area compared to the solvent control ( Figure 4J adapted from Masjosthusmann et al. ). Neuronal differentiation and maturation are tightly regulated processes, which are controlled by a variety of different signaling pathways, whose perturbation can cause severe adverse neurodevelopmental effects."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Bis-I\",\"MIE\",\"PKC inhibition\"\n\"narciclasine\",\"MIE\",\"RhoA activation\""}]}

However, to make an accurate assessment of the environmental risk, the quantification of chemical residues should be complemented with the investigation of biomarkers that serve as early warning signals. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is an enzyme that has been widely used as a sensitive biomarker of exposure to OP and CB pesticides. The OPs and CBs inhibits AChE which, in turn, hydrolyses acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter at cholinergic nerve synapses. These include the postganglionic parasympathetic and cholinergic sympathetic nerves, and both sympathetic and parasympathetic preganglionicfibres. Binding of OP with AChE leads to phosphorylation of the enzyme and this reaction is not easily reversible. The rate of spontaneous reactivation of AChE is very slow with diethyl OPs while it is relatively fast with dimethyl OPs."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Our study demonstrated that an MEA-based assay for measuring development of rat cortical network activity is amenable for medium-throughput screening of environmental compounds. Application of the assay to 86 compounds revealed that most known developmental neurotoxins impact 1 or more aspects of neural activity following exposure during network formation in vitro. Additionally, many compounds exhibited selectivity by producing network activity or coordination effects at concentrations lower than those resulting in decreased cell viability. Of DNT reference compounds, 82% altered network development. Although fewer unknown compounds were tested, only 50% altered network function, and the small number of those that are generally regarded as safe were without effects, with the exception of sorbitol. Overall, these results support the hypothesis that DNT compounds will alter network activity following exposure during development at a higher rate than non-neurotoxic compounds. Going forward, this assay of neural network function will be an important component of a battery of more rapid and scalable DNT hazard screening tools.

This specificity may not be captured by gill, liver, and gut cell lines. This sentiment is one that is reflected in the OECD test guideline 249 document, in which the gill cell has been described as not being well suited to study neurotoxic chemicals that act through specific ion channels or receptors typically found in the brain. The one fungicide we studied, chlorothalonil, was among the top three most toxic compounds tested, with EC50 values that ranged from approximately 1 to 3 µ M across all cell lines. Chlorothalonil has been determined to be acutely toxic to fish in vivo. It acts as a protectant fungicide that deactivates thiols, in particular glutathione, to prevent fungal spore germination, respiration, and glycolysis. Glutathione is a well-conserved antioxidant across phyla, so toxicity in nontarget species is not surprising. Of the 57 cell line-pesticide combinations studied here, 28 yielded cytotoxic responses (up to test concentrations that were either 100 or 1000 µ M). However, this also means that approximately 50% of the cell line-pesticide combinations did not yield a cytotoxicity value even though all the pesticides in our study have lethality data in vivo. Many of these exceptions were discussed previously. The presence of false negatives could be driven by the lack of in vivo biological processes, physicochemical properties of the test compounds, or study design considerations."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"clothianidin\",\"MIE\",\"selectivity for insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors\"\n\"imidacloprid\",\"MIE\",\"selectivity for insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors\"\n\"thiamethoxam\",\"MIE\",\"selectivity for insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors\"\n\"chlorothalonil\",\"MIE\",\"deactivation of thiols/glutathione\""}]}

Pesticide exposure has different acute and chronic effects, including cancer, asthma, diabetes, and neurodegeneration. One of the main mechanisms underlying reasons of pesticide toxicity is oxidative stress. Pesticides have induced oxidative stress mechanisms in relation with diseases, and this is still a question of debate. Oxidative stress is a cellular homeostatic imbalance between ROS and antioxidants. While ROS increases in the cell, ROS products interact with important cellular molecules and cause detrimental effects in the cell that bring about several different diseases. Antioxidants are very important cellular soldiers against ROS products. There are several different studies on the oxidative stress induction effects of pesticides in the literature."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"pesticides\",\"AO\",\"Acute and chronic health effects including cancer, asthma, diabetes, neurodegeneration\""}]}

To reduce variation attributed to cortical culture batch and plateto-plate variability, the 17 individual network parameters quantified from recordings werefirst divided by the median value of untreated control wells run on the same plate and same DIV to obtain fold-change values. Log-transformed fold-change values were then standardized by subtracting the mean fold-change and standard deviation of the same DIV untreated control wells. Standardizing to the distribution of all untreated control wells on each DIV yielded z-score values that re flected the number of standard deviations away from normal at each time point; ensuring that all network parameters were measured on a common scale (Fig. 2). Examination of z-score values over time revealed a number of different trajectories a network might take depending on the concentration of compound present. For a compound that did not appreciably impact network activity, such as acetaminophen, all concentrations resulted in network parameter trajectories that vary within the normal range of controls (Fig. 2B). In contrast, for compounds that significantly perturbed normal network development, such as haloperidol, a concentration-response relationship was often observed whereby the zscore perturbation exits the normal range of controls in a positive or negative direction at certain timepoints and this departure becomes more pronounced with increasing concentration (Fig. 2C)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Acetaminophen\",\"KE\",\"No appreciable impact on network activity\"\n\"Haloperidol\",\"KE\",\"Perturbation of normal network development with partial recovery at intermediate concentrations\""}]}

In addition, the pairwise correlation (Pearson's r) between any 2 network parameters was relatively low across the 86 compound dataset (Supplementary Figure 1D). Only the number of active electrodes and number of actively bursting electrodes measures shared a correlation of > 0.9. These results indicate the 17 network parameters measured describe distinct aspects of neuronal network development and suggest that a consideration of multiple parameters may be helpful in assessing the full range of network changes due to compound exposure. To identify concentration-response relationships that indicated network function was impacted by compound exposure, an AUC metric was calculated for each MEA well that summed the network parameter values over the 12days. Examples of the data used to develop the AUC values are shown in Figure 2. This approach simplified the comparison of different developmental trajectories and was able to identify effects appearing as delays in the development of network activity (eg, emamectin) or as alterations in the level of one of the 17 parameters evaluated (eg, DEHP)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Though their effects varied, type II pyrethroids induced Bdnf eIV-IX mRNA expression, while type I pyrethroids did not.

The same is true for an important TCA cycle enzyme, pyruvate carboxylase, also located specifically in astrocytes. It is therefore likely that the observed effect on the TCA cycle was due to utilization of the intermediate metabolites, as opposed to production. The switch from TCA cycle metabolism to predominantly glycolytic metabolism would drastically reduce available energy levels in the cell and have an impact on cell survival, which would account for the significant decrease in the number of viable cells after malathion exposure compared to no exposure at 24 hours (Figure 1A). This was also an observed difference in response to permethrin exposure, which had increased levels of TCA cycle intermediates compared to no exposure, and significantly more viable cells present than for malathion exposure at 24 hours. Interestingly, previous studies on permethrin exposure in rats showed the opposite results to this study and a decrease in TCA cycle intermediates (malate, citrate and 2 -oxoglutarate) following exposure to permethrin, yet they did not report on glycolytic intermediates, or pyruvate. This suggests that further efforts into the interpretation of the central energy metabolic pathways are hugely important to advance in metabolomics studies.

Much evidence has recently emerged that BDNF affects dendritic structures, which are thought to be essential to synaptic plasticity. In addition, the level of BDNF expression in the brain changes in patients with neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer ' s, Parkinson ' s and Huntington ' s disease or psychiatric disorders including depression and schizophrenia. Thus, it seems highly possible that the expression of BDNF in the brain plays a fundamental role in expressing a variety of neuronal functions and its impairment induces neuronal diseases. The BDNF gene ( Bdnf ) consists of eight 5 exons (exons I w VIII) and a common 3 exon (exon IX), encoding a preproBDNF protein. Nine promoters, Bdnf promoter I w IX ( BdnfpI w pIX ), were mapped upstream of the exons, each of which is controlled differently in the brain.

Therefore, differences in data obtained within these assays are not necessarily evidential of a false detection. These differences may result from several differences in the assay setup, i.e., species differences and exposure schemes. The hNNF and rNNF assays are based on the same basic cell types, namely neurons and astrocytes, but derived from different species (hNNF: human iPSC-derived neurons and primary astroglia; rNNF: rat primary neocortical cells). It is widely accepted that the predictability of non-human-based assays for human health is limited by species differences. Also, primary neural progenitor cells (NPC) derived from rats (PND5) are more sensitive towards exposure to DNT compounds compared to time-matched primary human NPCs in vitro. These two systems differ not only in their sensitivity but also with regard to their molecular equipment notwithstanding similar cellular functions. Recently, the co-culture system applied in this study was used for comparing acute effects of neurotoxic compounds on network activity to rodent cultures (rNNF) and revealed a considerable delay in human iPSC-derived neuronal and glial co-culture compared to rat cortical cultures.

The positive effect of Notch inhibition on neuronal differentiation is thought to be - at least in part - attributed to suppression of the Rho GTPase RhoA. Consistent with this notion, narciclasine, an activator of RhoA, reduced neuronal differentiation of primary hNPCs cultured for 5 days in a concentration-dependent manner, together with a less sensitive reduction of the nuclei number ( Figures 4D,E adapted from Masjosthusmann et al. ). Increased RhoA activity correlated with reduced neuronal differentiation of murine neural stem cells and human iPSCs. In contrast, inactivated RhoA signaling was sufficient to stimulate axon regeneration and recovery of hindlimb function after spinal cord injury in mice supporting the concept of RhoA activity as an inhibitory driver of neurogenesis. Besides the generation of adequate neuronal numbers during neurogenesis, neuronal maturation, especially neurite outgrowth, and branching are equally important for the functional maturation of the CNS.

In addition, the inhibition of VGCCs appeared not or slowly reversible. The observation of not or slowly reversible inhibition of VGCCs in subchronic exposure conditions suggests that a single subchronic (24 h) exposure could have prolonged consequences for VGCCs function. Prolonged effects of insecticides on neurotoxicological targets have been reported before in vitro, eg, a decrease in GABA receptor function by long-term (6 days) dieldrin exposure. Also, in vivo studies indicated that subacute and repeated exposure to chlorpyrifos could result in persistent effects on neurotoxicological endpoints, eg, neurobiochemistry and neurobehavior were permanently changed by chlorpyrifos in animals. We therefore hypothesized that the not or slowly reversible inhibition of VGCCs could affect the response upon subsequent repeated exposure, in particular for persistent and bioaccumulative chemicals like endosulfan. Our experiments demonstrate that repeated exposure indeed augmented the insecticide-induced inhibition of VGCC. However, our experiments with repeated exposure conditions also reveal that cypermethrin, chlorpyrifos-oxon, and endosulfan are basically equipotent in inhibiting VGCCs in a repeated exposure condition compared with acute exposure (Table 2).

The calculation equations are as follows. ``` ( 1 ) ΔG = ΔG + ΔG GLYPH<0> TΔS ( 2 ) ΔG = ΔE + ΔE + ΔE ( 3 ) ΔE = ΔE + ΔE + ΔE ``` Among them, ΔG GAS is the mechanical free energy of the gas molecules, which contains internal energy Δ E, van der Waals interactions Δ EVDW and electrostatic interactions Δ EELE The internal energy Δ EINT includes bond energy Δ E, bond angle energy Δ Eangels and dihedral angle energy Δ Edihedrals. Δ solv is the solvation free energy, which can be subdivided into polarization energy Δ GPB and non-polarization energy Δ GSA. T Δ S refers to the entropic change. Since the entropy change during translation, rotation and vibration had little effect on the binding free energy, it was neglected in this study."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Thus, the ''fit-for-purpose'' of the assay needs further investigation in this regard. The present studies were designed to test subsets of compounds from the ToxCast phase I and II inventories in primary cultures of cortical neuronal networks grown on mwMEAs. The compounds tested were selected based on their activity (or lack thereof) in NVS\\_IC ion channel assays in ToxCast, or their known neurotoxicity in vivo. This allowed for the testing of two separate but related hypotheses: (1) compounds testing positive in NVS\\_IC ion channel assays will alter network mean firing rate; and (2) compounds that alter firing rate will be neuroactive or neurotoxic in vivo. Because the NVS\\_IC assays consider only a subset of all potential MIEs that could alter network firing rate, it is not reasonable to expect that compounds that are negative in these assays will necessarily be without effects on network firing rate measured using MEAs. In total, 92 unique compounds were examined using MEAs (saccharin was included in both cohorts), including 6 inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), 10 compounds active on GABA receptors, 9 compounds that alter voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) function and 7 compounds known to act on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"saccharin\",\"KE\",\"Decreased neuronal network firing rate\""}]}

Of the 19 pesticides tested, 11, 9, and 8 were cytotoxic to the RTgill-W1, RTL-W1, and RTgutGC cells, respectively.

Several studies have shown that pyrethroids affect VGCCs at the same concentration range as for VGSCs. It has been reported that type II pyrethroid promotes the release of the synapse neurotransmitter via targeting VGCCs. In addition, recent studies have demonstrated that pyrethroids including allethrin and deltamethrin inhibit T, L, P/Qand N-type voltage-activated Ca channels in oocytes. Therefore, inhibition of calcium dynamics and VGCC activity plays an important role in the toxicity of pyrethroids. Caenorhabditis elegans ( C. elegans ) as a popular model organism has conserved physiology and pharmacology with parasitic nematodes and has been exploited to provide insight into the mode of action of anthelmintic or nematicide. The C. elegans genomecontainsfive genes encoding putative VGCC α 1 subunit egl -19, cca -1, unc -2, nca -1 and nca2. Sequence analysis has shown that egl -19, unc -2, and cca -1 are homologues to the vertebrate α 1 subunits conducting L-type, P/Q/R/Ntype, and T-type VGCC, respectively. The unc -2 is primarily expressed in motor neurons, several subsets of sensory neurons, and the HSN and VC neurons controlling egg-laying. In situ characterization of voltage-gated calcium currents has shown that the α 1 subunit cca -1 underlies a T-type current in pharyngeal muscle whereas egl -19 carries L-type currents both in pharyngeal and body muscles.

Furthermore, calculations of the free energy using the MMPBSA module also suggested that the binding stability of the permethrin was better. Moreover, it was evident from the energy breakdown that van der Waals forces were the main driving force for ligand binding in both systems, while polar solvent solventisation was the main inhibiting force for binding. To further examine and determine the binding of the two complex systems, zebrafish exposure experiments were conducted on the basis of the above. The results showed that both pesticides had some estrogenic activity and that this activity was positively correlated with the pesticide concentration.

To provide mechanistic evidence for this speculation, future metabolomics studies could include cultured cells supplemented with radioisotope -labelled glutamine, as a way of tracking the directional flow through metabolic pathways of glutamine to glutamate, and the conversion into other amino acids. In this study the most notable, specific difference between the two insecticide exposures was that of the TCA cycle intermediates and pyruvate (Figure 4), where both chemical exposures resulted in substantial and opposite responses from control in these metabolites, indicating that energy synthesis was disrupted in both circumstances to different extents. Pyruvate had the opposite response to the TCA cycle intermediates with both permethrin and malathion exposure. Permethrin exposure showed decreased pyruvate abundance compared to increased TCA cycle intermediates, while malathion exposure showed an increased abundance of pyruvate compared to decreased TCA cycle intermediates. Further to the earlier suggestion of glutamate -mediated excitotoxicity in malathion -exposed cells, it may be possible that if glutamate was being converted into other amino acids as an attempted protective mechanism, this would reduce the glutamate available to power the TCA cycle (via the glutamate/ glutamine cycle), and so account for the significantly decreased abundance of TCA cycle intermediates in malathion -exposed cells at 24 hours (Figure 4)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"permethrin\",\"KE\",\"Decreased pyruvate\"\n\"malathion\",\"KE\",\"Substantial increase in most detectable amino acids after 6 h\""}]}

Graphs showing Zscores and total scalar perturbations are available for all compounds at the following doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.23719/1407690. The decision to model system scalar perturbation as a function of 9 of the 17 network parameters measured was made for two reasons. First, the 9 selected parameters (MFR, #AE, BR, #ABE, %SiB, #NS, % SiNS, r, and MI) are directly calculated from the recording spike trains, as opposed to the other 8 network parameters that are dependent upon non-zero values for one of the selected parameters. For example, the mean network spike duration (NSD) is dependent upon the observation of at least one network spike during the recording time, else it remains undefined. At earlier time points in development, the cortical cultures have little or no network spiking and bursting activity and this results in many undefined values for the dependent parameters that could introduce extra uncertainty into the analysis. Second, it was found that random selection of 9 out of the 17 network parameters for calculation of total system perturbation did not qualitatively alter the overall concentration-dependent trajectories of network scalar perturbation (data not shown)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Haloperidol\",\"KE\",\"Apparent network failure at highest concentrations\""}]}

In conclusion, the results of the present study show that pyrethroids have an effect on the viability of SH-SY5Y neuronal cells, and that toxicity seems to depend on the chemical structure of pyrethroids. In the evaluation of cell toxicity, the methods used gave different results. The total ATP test revealed cytotoxicity more clearly than WST-1 method. But the result is due to the different endpoints the tests are based on, and the activation of mitochondrial enzymes may prove to be important when evaluating the significance of the results. Microscopic photographs of exposed cell cultures correlated to the toxic effects revealed by the metabolic tests. Pyrethroids are important insecticides used largely because of their high activity as an insecticide and their low mammalian toxicity. Some studies have demonstrated that these products, especially compounds with an -cyano group, show neurotoxic effects on the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). In this study, we investigate with different methods the cell toxic effects of commercial, chemically different pyrethroid compounds on neuronal cell line SH-SY5Y. Natural pyrethrin and permethrin (both with no -cyano group) and cypermethrin (with an -cyano group), were studied. For toxicity determinations, SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were exposed to pyrethroids at 0.1-100 M concentrations for 1 day."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"pyrethrin\",\"KE\",\"Early morphological cell damage\"\n\"permethrin\",\"KE\",\"Early morphological cell damage\"\n\"cypermethrin\",\"KE\",\"Early morphological cell damage\""}]}

This might be due to parameters compensat ing each other, like penthiopyrad decreasing the number of spikes per burst and increasing the burst frequency at the same time or BMCs being close to the upper testing limit, like for β-cyfluthrin. In the last years, scientists from academia, industry, and regulatory authorities across the world agreed on the need for a standardized in vitro testing strategy, aiming for a cheaper and faster generation of additional data for DNT hazard assessment. This resulted in the compilation of a DNT IVB, which includes various test methods covering different KEs of neurodevelopment, including the formation and function of neural networks. One of the gaps identified in the DNT IVB is the assessment of network formation and function in a human-based cell model. To fill this gap, we established the human neural network formation assay (hNNF), which consists of hiPSC-derived excitatory and inhibitory neurons and primary astroglia (SynFire, NeuCyte, USA). The functionality of neuronal subtypes and the ability of the cell model to detect alterations via a known MoA were confirmed by pharmacological modulation. When challenged with a test set of 28 substances, the assay revealed compound-specific effects of different pesticides on network development."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"penthiopyrad\",\"KE\",\"Decreased spikes per burst\"\n\"rotenone\",\"KE\",\"Reduced multiple network parameters\""}]}

For this purpose, we synthesized several derivatives of DM, by replacing the cyano group with an ethynyl group possessing various substituents at its terminal to improve the chemical stability. These changes also avoid a production of a harmful hydrolysate. We then evaluated the effects of these derivatives on Bdnf eIV-IX mRNA expression and the morphological changes in neurons. Figure 1 shows the chemical structure of DM ( 1 ), a representative type II pyrethroid, which contains an O -acyl cyanohydrin substructure at the benzylic position ( a -position). This functional group is likely to be susceptible to hydrolytic (or some other nucleophilic) degradation to yield an aldehyde and hydrogen cyanide as mentioned above. Here we envisaged that replacement of the cyano group (a carbon-nitrogen triple bond) with an ethynyl group (a carbon-carbon triple bond) would increase the stability of the compound, leading to more promising and safer candidates for an agent to treat neuronal disorders.

Only two out of the 42 compounds (4.8%), emamectin benzoate and mevastatin, exhibited high cytotoxicity at concentrations lower than the tipping point estimate. For all other compounds, there was at least a 4-fold difference between the tipping point and cytotoxicity EC. The mean difference between 50% cell viability (where defined) and tipping point concentration was 13.8-fold. This suggests that tipping points often occur at concentrations substantially lower than those causing high levels of cell viability loss in the cortical networks.

Their chief advantages are high insecticidal potency and low mammalian toxicity. The pyrethroids have a highly nonpolar nature, low water solubility and high affinity to soil and sediment particulate matter. Pyrethroids show low mobility in soil and are absorbed to the sediments of natural water systems. Despite the high attachment of pyrethroids to living organisms, their capability to bioconcentrate is mitigated by their metabolism and subsequent elimination. However, there have been cases of accidental and occupational human exposures after dermal contact which have lead to acute pyrethroid poisonings. Natural pyrethrin is extracted from the flowers of Chrysanthemum spp., and its use was already known in China in the first century A.D. Pyrethroids, synthetic analogues of pyrethrin, have been produced since 1940. They are more stable in light and air than natural pyrethrin. Today there are many different synthetic pyrethroids. The increasing demand for pyrethroid products has lead chemists to focus their attention on the synthesis of new analogues with better stability in light and air, better persistence, more selectivity in target species, and lower mammalian toxicity. The natural pyrethrins are more active poisons via dermal contacts than when ingested. Human toxicity associated with pyrethroids may stem from their allergenic properties."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

McConnell a, Maxine A. McClain a,1, James Ross a, William R. LeFew b, Timothy J. Shafer b, * The National Academy of Sciences report on '' Toxicity testing in the 21st century '' highlighted the need for efficient in vitro methods to screen chemicals for their potential to cause toxicity. This report proposed that high-throughput/high content in vitro screening (HTS/HCS) assays would facilitate hazard identification for thousands of chemicals for which toxicological information is lacking. Such screening approaches will need to link changes measured at the cellular or subcellular level to adverse effects through a toxicity pathway so that there will be confidence in predicting toxicological outcomes in vivo. Many HTS/HCS endpoints assess changes in biochemical and/or cellular morphology markers, such as enzyme activity, receptor binding affinity, cell morphology, or physiological endpoints, such as regulation of intracellular calcium, sodium, membrane potential and ion channel function. When considering the problem of screening compounds for the potential to disrupt nervous system function, physiological assessment is crucial, as disruption of ion channels, receptors and other critical determinants of neuronal excitability are key events in the toxicity pathways of many known neurotoxicants. Disruption of neuronal excitability produces substantial and rapid disruption of nervous system physiology, and often precedes or occurs in the absence of other biochemical or morphological changes. Examples include insecticides, a variety of convulsants and metals, as well as a wide range of natural toxins."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

These data indicate that some fungicides activate toxicity pathways impacting network function as measured by MEAs. However, fungicides differ from many of the other compounds tested here in two important aspects. First, the MIE or MIEs are not as clear, since even conazoles that did not activate NVS\\_IC ion channel assays impacted neuronal function in the MEAs. Perhaps this involves toxicity pathways linked to firing rate via disruptions of calcium homeostasis, as recent work by Heusinkveld et al. demonstrated that 6 fungicides (imazalil, flusilazole, fluconazole, tebuconazole, triadiamefon and cyproconazole) alter intracellular calcium homeostasis, and viability in PC12 cells. Only fluconazole, which was also inactive in the MEA assay, was without effects on calcium responses. Second, it is not clear if and how these compounds contribute to adverse outcome pathways, as many fungicides are not recognized to cause neurotoxicity. To this end, when 14 different conazole compounds were examined for effects on motor activity, including three common to those used here (diniconazole, hexaconazole and propriconazole), only triadimefon caused significant effects. Although triadimefon was not tested in the current experiments, it does alter cortical network activity in MEAs (unpublished data).

For example, MEA recordings have demonstrated that neural network activity is sensitive to disruption by heavy metals, pyrethroid insecticides, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, and GABA and glutamate receptor agonists and antagonists. While the ability of MEAs to detect changes induced by chemicals acting through a broad variety of different targets makes this approach useful as a screen to detect effects of uncharacterized chemicals, approaches to classify such effects into different pathways would improve further the utility of MEA data. Therefore, the goal of the current studies was to provide proofof-concept for chemical classification, or ''fingerprinting'' using MEA data. Spontaneous electrical activity in neural networks consists of action potentials (spikes) and organized patterns of action potential bursts (Fig. 1). Most commonly, chemical effects on network function focus on disruption of network firing (spike) rate, as this measure is sensitive to disruption by chemical exposure and can be easily and quickly extracted from the data files. However, spontaneous activity in primary cultures is further organized across time and space in the network (e.g. synchrony of activity).

Generally speaking, the smaller the value of the binding free energy, the higher the affinity of the ligand and the more stable the binding to the receptor. It could be seen that the binding free energy of bifenthrin to the receptor was GLYPH<0> 35.66 kcal/mol compared to GLYPH<0> 38.61 kcal/mol for permethrin, indicating that the binding of permethrin was much more stable, which was consistent with the RMSD results. This result was probably related to the greater number of polar amino acid residues around the permethrin which generated a stronger van der Waals interaction. Though the trifluoromethyl group of bifenthrin, as a polar group, might also generate electrostatic forces with the surrounding polar amino acids, this interaction obviously did not contribute as much as the van der Waals interaction to the overall binding free energy, which was also evident from the energy components.

It is widely used in agriculture, forestry, and household products because of some favorable properties such as wide spectrum, relatively low mammalian toxicity, and rapid biodegradability. However, widespread application of pyrethroids has caused to toxic effects in plants, animals, and human beings. Cypermethrin has been reported to exert carcinogenic activity in both sexes of Swiss albino mice. It has been suggested that cypermethrin causes free radical-mediated damage in erythrocytes and brain and liver tissues. The genotoxic and/or cytotoxic potential of cypermethrin has been shown in previous studies. It slightly increased the number of micronucleated cells in whole blood lymphocyte cultures in human. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that cypermethrin induces chromosomal aberrations and micronucleus formation in mouse bone marrow and spleen. The 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), a chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbon acid pesticide, has been in extensive use since 1944, in agriculture for broad-leaved weeds, control of woody plants, and reforestation programs. It is classified as group II-B carcinogenic agent by IARC. Major target organ systems of 2,4-D toxicity are the central nervous system and the cardiovascular system. Despite the toxicity of 2,4-D, has been a topic of extensive research, mechanism of toxic action caused to carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, or genotoxicity is poorly understood (IARC, 1982; Nesnow Fig. 1.

Considering the small dataset, these results provide proof-of-concept that, with improvements, such approaches may be useful to categorize previously uncharacterized compounds (''unknowns'') into effect classes. Overall, the PCA identified four general clusters of chemicals. The first, which included the GABA antagonists LND, BIC and RDX, consisted of compounds that caused clear increases in MFR and bursts per minute. This cluster separated most clearly from the others based on 95% confidence limits. The second cluster consisted of GLY, NIC and PTX, which separate completely from all chemicals except for DELT and FLU. These chemicals were less effective at altering MFR, but altered other burst parameters.

However, as there are several compounds (for example, the conazoles) that were positive in the MEA assay that were not hits in the ToxCast NVS\\_IC assays, it is clear that there are other MIEs that can have toxicity pathways leading to altered firing in neuronal networks. A number of the compounds tested in these cohorts are well recognized to disrupt function of receptors, channels or enzymes important to nervous system function, and in some cases there were multiple compounds with common nervous system targets; as such, these targets could also be considered as molecular initiating events in toxicity pathways leading to adverse outcomes. A comparison between the responses in the NVS\\_IC and MEA assays for these compounds is presented in Table 4. In general, there were 6 compounds known to cause AChE inhibition, 10 compounds known to interact with GABA receptors, 7 nicotinic agonists, and 9 modifiers of VGSC. In the single point screens, 5/6 of the AChE inhibitors were hits. Aldicarb was the only AChE inhibitor that did not cause a change in the wMFR greater than the threshold. Similarly, 9/10 GABA modifiers were hits, with heptachlor epoxide being the only compound that was not a hit in the initial screen.

Reasons for discrepancies between in vitro and in vivo results are detailed below, and may relate to the class of chemical under investigation, mechanisms underpinning bioavailability and toxic action, study design, and variability with the in vivo LC50 values, which largely hail from single studies. Most of the cytotoxic pesticides in the present study were classified as herbicides. All 10 herbicides tested, except for atrazine, metribuzin, and glyphosate, caused cytotoxicity in at least one experiment. Perhaps it is not surprising that atrazine and metribuzin did not cause cytotoxicity in any of the three cell lines because their target mode of action (inhibiting photosystem II in photosynthesis) is a structure not found in animal cells.

Moreover, PD153035 reportedly suppressed proliferation of murine neural stem cells in vitro. These data -especially from the in vivo studies -support the importance of the EGFR pathway for NPC proliferation. As a chemical exerting adverse effects on hNPC proliferation, we selected cadmium chloride. Prenatal exposure to cadmium chloride is associated with a lower child intelligence score, memory deficits, and learning disabilities in children. In rodents, cadmium causes behavioral and neurotoxicological changes. Hence, it is listed amongst the compounds triggering DNT. Cadmium is acting via the induction of oxidative stress, thus causing cell death and affecting mTOR, Erk1/2, and JNK signaling pathway activity. In mouse neural stem/progenitor cells, cadmium remarkably influenced the expression of genes related to cell growth, proliferation, cell cycle, and survival. In the present study, concentration-dependent inhibition of hNPC proliferation was observed following exposure to cadmium chloride compared to the solvent control without any observed cytotoxicity ( Figure 2E adapted from Masjosthusmann et al. ). Of note, the effects on NPC1b (BrdU incorporation) were much more pronounced compared to NPC1a (sphere size), highlighting that NPC1b is the more sensitive endpoint since differences in DNA replication by far precede the microscopic changes.

In an additional study, it has been reported that 2,4-D or other phenoxy herbicides may cause non-Hodgkin's lymphoma through lymphocyte or immune alteration. Blakley et al. suggested that alterations in lymphocyte proliferation may be a possible mechanism since lymphocytes are one of the targets of 2,4-D. On the other hand, negative findings in rat and hamster models using different techniques such as micronucleus (MN) assay, hypoxanthine-guanine-phospho-ribosyl transferase (HGPRT), and Ames test have also been reported. There is evidence for higher chromosomal damage in the somatic cells of smokers than in nonsmokers. The result of structural chromosome aberration test (SCA), micronucleus test (MN), and sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) have indicated that scores of SCE, SCA, and MN in lymphocytes of smokers are higher than nonsmokers. Conversely, some other studies have suggested that smoking has no additional effect on genetic damage. Various techniques (e.g., MN and SCA) have been used to identify substances with genotoxic activity. A more useful method for assessing the level of DNA damage is suggested to be the alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis, also known as comet assay. This method has previously been used to assess genotoxicity of cigarette smoke on human lymphocytes.

Metabolite profiling (metabolomics/metabonomics) provides unique insights into the metabolic pathways of cells via the simultaneous, untargeted analysis of the small molecules (or metabolites) within a biological sample. Metabolomics has been widely applied in the field of toxicology, mainly in the context of animal studies and the analysis of urine or plasma for the discovery of biomarkers of toxic chemical exposure. There are studies that have utilized mammalian cell culture metabolomics to look specifically at the metabolic effects of toxic chemical exposure, only a handful of these have specifically investigated neurotoxicity including exposure to thalidomide, methyl -mercury and caffeine. There is clearly great potential in the application of mammalian cell culture metabolomics in the study of insecticide toxicology, and metabolomics has been suggested to be an important technique in the development of new, safer pesticide chemicals. The B50 neuroblastoma cell line was derived from the rat neonatal central nervous system and is in wide use today in studies of central nervous system neurons in culture. B50 cells have been used extensively to study neuronal cell death and neurotoxicity, and are very simple to grow, making them an ideal model to investigate the potential of metabolomics in the assessment of neurotoxicity."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Hence, narciclasinemediated activation of RhoA could cause a hyperstabilization of the cytoskeleton and thus impair migration. This was observed in PARK2 knockout hiPSC-derived neurons, where migration was reduced by RhoA upregulation and rescued by RhoA inhibition. Likewise, methylmercury, a metal disturbing neural migration in humans, affected hiNPC and hNPC migration at similar concentrations. Taken together, hiNPC proliferation and migration (iNPC1/ 2) work similarly as in primary hNPCs (NPC1/2). More work is needed to understand if these two test systems have also distinct applicability domains, i.e. concerning developmental timing, or if these are redundant assays. Nevertheless, primary NPCs produce oligodendrocytes within a very short time of 5 days, whereas hiPSCs need several weeks to produce oligodendrocytes. In addition, the convolutional neuronal networks were trained to quantify neuron and oligodendrocyte differentiation in the primary NPC assays. This has not been established for differentiating hiNPC, hence objective quantification methods for cell differentiation are lacking for this test system. Therefore, the primary neurosphere assay possesses its unique selling points. 3.7 Applications of the Neurosphere Assay The Neurosphere test methods, which allow studying a large variety of neurodevelopmental KE, are suitable for many different applications ranging from basic scientific to different regulatory questions."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"methylmercury\",\"KE\",\"reduced NPC migration\""}]}

Calculation of network scalar perturbations Complex primary cultures isolated from newborn rat cortex exhibit a reproducible developmental trajectory as neurite outgrowth leads to synaptogenesis and increasing network activity over approximately two weeks in vitro. mwMEA recordings over this time period provide multiparametric data that includes measures of spike, burst, and network synchrony in each culture. Our previous work demonstrated that many compounds that are developmentally neurotoxic in mammals perturb these parameters. Because of the temporal nature of our previous data, it was possible to determine a critical concentration at which a given compound began to perturb the developing system beyond recovery. Such concentrations may represent the transition point in the series of events that results in developmental neurotoxicity. To determine these tipping points, it wasfirst necessary to transform network parameter data into values that define a distance from normal activity range."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

The two compounds from this group that did not replicate were nicotine which was without effect in the present study, and valproic acid, which increased activity above threshold, rather than decreasing it. However, the concentrations of valproate reported to decrease activity were 300-700 m M, much higher than tested in the present studies. These data indicate that assessment of drug and chemical effects on neuronal network function is a robust approach that is reproducible across laboratories and platforms and is consistent with a previous study focused on reproducibility of MEA results. The lack of nicotine effect was confirmed in the present study by testing it at a single concentration of 50 m M in another system, as well as testing the concentration-response to nicotine.

Mechanism of 2,4-D induced genotoxicity and its correlation with smoking habit should be further investigated. Cigarette smoke contains a large number of substances that are hazardous to human health. Smoking habits cause DNA damage in human lymphotyctes. Impact of smoking habit on mutagenic effects of pesticide exposure has long been questioned. In a study conducted on cotton field workers who were exposed to several persistent pesticides; total frequency of chromosomal aberrations in smokers was more than those determined in the unexposed population ( n 5 20). It was reported that these subjects were exposed to dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane, benzene hexa chloride, endosulfan, malathion, methyl parathion, monocrotophos, quinolphos, dimethoate, phosphomidon, cypermethrin, and fenvelrate in the cotton fields. However, others have suggested that smoking has no additional effect on genetic damage. In our study, we did not determine additional genotoxic effects of the pesticides tested (except 2,4-D) on human lymphocytes collected from smoking subjects. This discrepancy may be attributed to long exposure period of some of these pesticides in smoker workers compared to very short incubation period in vitro in our study."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"2,4-D\",\"KE\",\"Increased DNA damage in smokers at 10 µM\"\n\"cypermethrin\",\"KE\",\"Increased DNA damage in human lymphocytes at high concentration\""}]}

According to the symptoms in animals receiving acute toxic doses, the pyrethroids form two groups. Type I pyrethroids such as pyrethrin and permethrin cause hyperexcitation, ataxia, convulsions, and paralysis. Type II pyrethroids such as cypermethrin, cause hypersensitivity, tremors, and paralysis. Despite some differences in the symptoms, the primary targets for both types are the cell membrane and the sodium channel in the neural tissue. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxicity of three commercial pyrethroid products (Biospray S, a pyrethrin mixture; Biokill, a permethrin mixture; Ripcord, a cypermethrin mixture) as well as the sensitivity of the two conventional tests and microscopic photographs.

Parameter relationships were further described by pairwise Pearson's correlation of the centered and scaled data. Undefined network parameter values (eg, mean interburst interval is undefined when no burst events are recorded) at DIV 5 and DIV 7 were excluded from these analyses. To establish potency values for compounds that impacted network activity, including both decreased terminal DIV 12 activity and delayed development of activity over time, the temporal component of each well's recordings was reduced to a single area under the curve (AUC) value, as described previously. Trapezoidal AUC was calculated for each well over DIV 2-12, allowing for flexibility in developmental trajectory shape. A concentration-response relationship was then determined for each network parameter by a change in mean AUC (as percent of median untreated well AUC) over increasing concentration. If at least one of the highest 2 concentrations tested produced a change in mean AUC beyond 3 times the median absolute deviation (MAD) of all untreated control well values, a Hill function was fit to the data with a fixed upper limit of 100% and lower limit of 0%."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Malathion, an organophosphate for which neurotoxic action is the inhibition of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase resulting in increased cholinergic signal transduction and excitotoxicity; it is known to elicit an excessive generation of reactive oxygen species and cause a state of oxidative stress within cells. However, this study suggests that malathion toxicity may also manifest via glutamate excitotoxicity, evident from the 13 -fold increase in pyroglutamate following 6 hours of malathion exposure (Figure 4). Pyroglutamate is the cyclized form of glutamate, and it is known that glutamate can be freely and non -enzymatically converted to pyroglutamate under high temperature conditions, such as within an ionization source for analysis by MS, and so levels of pyroglutamate can be considered indicative of changes in glutamate. Glutamate is the chief excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian nervous system and is known to be implicated in a wide variety of neurological pathologies. Previous investigations have shown that under stressed conditions neuronal cells will have an enhanced production of glutamate and that, as a protective mechanism against glutamate -mediated excitotoxicity, cells may attempt to reduce the accumulation of glutamate by converting it into other amino acids."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"malathion\",\"KE\",\"Increased cholinergic signal transduction and excitotoxicity (described)\"\n\"malathion\",\"KE\",\"Pyroglutamate increase after 6 h\"\n\"malathion\",\"KE\",\"Excessive generation of reactive oxygen species/oxidative stress (described)\"\n\"malathion\",\"MIE\",\"Acetylcholinesterase inhibition (described MOA)\"\n\"malathion\",\"KE\",\"Glutamate excitotoxicity (suggested by data)\""}]}

Usually, pyrethroids with an 𝛂 -cyano group are more toxic, but also the isomeric form has an effect on the toxic potency. Although this classification (types I and II) system is widely used, it has several defects for the identification of common toxic effects. It does not reflect the diversity of intoxication signs found following oral administration of various pyrethroids. A well-known toxic effect associated with synthetic pyrethroids is cutaneous paresthesia observed in workers spraying esters containing an 𝛂 -cyano substituent. Paresthesia occurs as a result of a direct effect on intracutaneous nerve endings at very low pyrethroid doses. Pyrethroids without an 𝛂 -cyano group generally show the weakest physiological effect. Non-cyano pyrethroids, such as permethrin, are thought to produce symptoms mainly through action on the peripheral nervous system. 𝛂 -Cyano pyrethroids, such as cypermethrin, produce symptoms of the central nervous system (CNS). Due to their lipophilic nature, pyrethroids are taken up by biological membranes and tissues. At the cellular level, pyrethroids act on a variety of biochemical and physiological target sites. The important target sites for both types I and II of pyrethroids in mammals are cell membrane and the sodium channels. Mammals have multiple sodium channel isoforms that vary in their biophysical and pharmacological properties, including their differential sensitivity to pyrethroids.

Next, a concentration-response curve was determined for the GABA receptor antagonist BIC. BIC induced a concentration-dependent increase in MFR, with an EC value of 0.30 m M (Fig. 3), which is consistent with laboratory historical values of 0.41 m M (unpublished data) for this compound. Over the course of the experiments with the chemical training set compounds (see Table 1), a total of 158 wells were recorded from 10 different cortical culture preparations. Averaged over all of the baseline recordings, there were 27 /C6 12.2 active electrodes/well (mean /C6 s.d., n = 158) and 49 /C6 27.3 spikes/min/well (mean /C6 s.d., n = 158). BIC (50 m M) and tetrodotoxin (1 m M) were evaluated as endpoint selective controls that increase and decrease activity, respectively. As an endpoint-selective control compound, BIC increased MFR to 131 /C6 13% of control values (mean /C6 s.d., n = 18). However, in several cases (8), the overall network response to BIC was either no net change or a decrease in MFR. This is consistent with previous observations in our laboratory as well as previous reports of heterogeneous network responses to bicuculline. If these 8 wells are removed, then the average increase in MFR was 165 /C6 13 ( n = 10). This is slightly lower than the laboratory historical value of 181% for BIC plus the GABA antagonist SCH50911."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Bicuculline\",\"MIE\",\"GABAA antagonist\""}]}

Differentiation of hiNPCs from higher passages (P25)first led to the emergence of S100 β -positive cells with RG-like morphology and subsequently of β (III) tubulin-positive neurons ( Figure 8A ). Regarding the S100 β -positive cells, one could distinguish between elongated RG-like cells ( Figure 8A, stars) and more star-shaped astrocytes ( Figure 8A, triangle), thefirst being overrepresented in differentiating hiNPCs from higher passages. Next, we inquired whether hiNPC neurospheres can also be used for studying neural migration. Therefore, we assessed the migratory capacity of hiNPC-derived cells (passages > 17). After plating on PDL-laminin-coated matrices, the hiNPC-derived cells formed a circular migration area comparable to the primary hNPCs. Moreover, as observed for the hNPCs ( Figure 3B ), the migration distance of cells emerging from hiNPCs increased over time ( Figure 8B ). After 72 h, hiNPC migration was shorter (~600 -750 µm) than hNPC migration (~950 µm, Figure 2 ), yet reproducible and fully sufficient for analyses. As discussed above, EGFR-dependent signaling guides radial migration in vivo. To study migratory responses to EGF in hiNPCs, we measured the migration distances of hiNPC-derived cells in presence and absence of EGF and the EGFR inhibitor PD153035."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Collectively, these results indicate that the NFA is sensitive to chemicals acting on nervous system function and will be a valuable contribution to an in vitro DNTscreening battery. Key words: developmental neurotoxicity; screening; microelectrode array; neural network formation. It is now well recognized that humans are exposed to thousands of chemicals that have not been fully characterized for their toxicity, including developmental neurotoxicity. Because animal-based guideline studies are time-consuming, expensive, and utilize large number of animals, they cannot provide the data needed to evaluate the potential hazards of thousands of chemicals, including DNT hazard. To address this gap in knowledge, considerable effort has been made over the last decade to develop low-cost, higher throughput in vitro assays to test chemicals for the potential to cause DNT. As a result, assays have now been developed for many processes that are critical to nervous system development, including expression of neurodevelopmentally-regulated genes, neuroprogenitor cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, apoptosis, neurite outgrowth, synaptogenesis, and neural network formation."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

In the current study, a recently described MEA-based screen of 86 compounds in primary rat cortical cultures over 12 days in vitro was revisited to establish a framework that integrates all available primary measures of electrical activity from MEA recordings into a composite metric for deviation from normal activity (total scalar perturbation). Examining scalar perturbations over time and increasing concentration of compound allowed for definition of critical concentrations or ' tipping points ' at which the neural networks switched from recovery to non-recovery trajectories for 42 compounds. These tipping point concentrations occurred at predominantly lower concentrations than those causing overt cell viability loss or disrupting individual network parameters, suggesting tipping points may be a more sensitive measure of network functional loss. Comparing tipping points for six compounds with plasma concentrations known to cause developmental neurotoxicity in vivo demonstrated strong concordance and suggests there is potential for using tipping points for chemical prioritization. ☆ Preparation of this document has been funded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

To further verify the reliability of the molecular docking results and the stability of the complexes, we conducted MDs for 50 ns on the complexes of bifenthrin and permethrin with zebrafish ER and got the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) of the main chain atoms and the Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF) of the amino acid residues of the two complex systems. It can be seen from Fig. 2 that the RMSD values of the permethrin complex gradually converge to equilibrium after 20 ns, which means that the system has reached a balanced state. In contrast, the RMSD of the bifenthrin complex remained in a fluctuating situation throughout the simulation, which implies that the stability of the complex is not satisfactory. It can also be seen that the RMSD of the permethrin complex was lower than that of the bifenthrin complex for the majority of the simulation, suggesting a greater stability of the permethrin complex.

The present studies utilized a ''data mining'' approach to test proof-of-concept for chemical classification approaches for MEA data. Concentration-response relationships for 16 chemicals on spontaneous activity in cortical networks demonstrated three distinct classes of effect on the network MFR; increased, decreased and no change. These results confirm previous studies demonstrating that MEA approaches be utilized to detect neuroactive/ neurotoxic substances as effects on MFR in the current set of experiments were consistent with previous data (Table 2).

The replacement of an oxygen atom in the organophosphorus structure by sulfur leads to the formation of organothiophosphorus compounds such as chlorpyrifos, malathion and parathion, which have a lower lethal potential. However, in vivo metabolisation to the oxon metabolite enhances their toxicity. There is a clear measurable potential for mixtures of OPs and carbamates in agricultural waters to cause AChE inhibition infield-exposedfish. Cypermethrin, a synthetic (Type II) pyrethroid acts on voltage-gated sodium and chloride channels in contrast to Type I pyrethroids that predominantly delay the closure of sodium channels. Pyrethroids are 2250 times more toxic to insects than humans. The mammalian resistance to pyrethroid toxicity is due to their capacity for ester hydrolysis leading to rapid detoxification. Carboxylesterase inhibitors such as OPs may enhance the toxicity of pyrethroid by inhibiting detoxification. Although OPs share a common mechanism of action, assessing cumulative risk from exposures to OP mixtures remains a challenge. In parallel to human health, OP mixture toxicity remains an important consideration for the conservation of non-target, non-mammalian species. Assessing the effects of mixtures of contaminants is an issue of high priority by many governmental agencies around the world. As the potential for multiple chemical exposure increases, the question raised is whether the toxicity of mixtures of chemicals is simply additive or whether there is potentiation of toxicity.

The survival rate of the cells was determined by diluting the cells and plating them on yPg Agar plates. The number of ρ-mutants was determined by examining the number of cells that hadn't grown on yPg medium from among all surviving cells.

The adverse effects of TBBPA on OL differentiation in the NPC5 assay were accompanied by deregulation of a gene cluster involved in cholesterol metabolism suggesting lipotoxicity as TBBPA ' s MoA. Since myelinating OLs exhibit an exceptionally high rate of cholesterol metabolism, disturbances are particularly problematic in this cell type. In the past, the NPC5 assay has been identifying compounds of various substance classes as disruptors of OL differentiation including brominated as well as alternative organophosphate FRs, sodium arsenite, and a variety of substances within a recent screening project where the NPC5 assay was the most frequently positive assay across the Neurosphere Assay battery. In neurotoxicological studies, oligodendrocytes are an understudied, yet highly relevant cell type that just recently received more attention. 3.5 Thyroid Hormone (TH)-dependent Oligodendrocyte Maturation (NPC6) In order to develop into myelinating OLs, OPCs and pre-OLs have to mature and express myelin-associated genes including myelin basic protein (MBP) and myelin proteolipid protein (PLP1).

Among the five pyrethroids studied here, Fen and Per have earlier been shown to induce MN in human lymphocytes. Thus, the main aim of this study was to investigate the ability of the five pyrethroids to induce MN and to reevaluate the MN induction by Fev and Per by using a different concentration of Cyt-B and a different methodology. Previous studies have demonstrated that the concentration of Cyt-B is an important variable affecting the efficiency of the cytokinesis block and the baseline and induced frequency of MN. We have suggested that, especially when a suboptimal Cyt-B concentration (such as 3 ~g/ml) is used to block cytokinesis, binucleated cells that have actually divided twice are included in the scoring. This fact could lead to an overestimation of genetic damage. Migliore et al. recommended that whole-blood (WB) cultures hould be used in the CBMN assay. However, it was recenty suggested that the sensitivity of the CBMN assay may be enhanced by using isolated lymphocytes (IL) instead of WB. Therefore, the five pyrethroids were tested in both WB and IL cultures, to see if one type of culture is superior to the other.

Neurogenesis during brain development is primarily regulated by the Notch signaling pathway, which is evolutionarily highly conserved and operates at many stages of human brain development. Stimulation of the Notch pathway could be correlated with impaired neuronal differentiation in vivo. In contrast, inhibited Notch signaling is known to accelerate neuronal differentiation in vitro and in vivo. This can be pharmacologically excited by the Notch receptor inhibitor N-[N-(3,5-Difluorophenacetyl)Lalanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT) through blockage of the presenilin-y-secretase complex. Moreover, the Notch pathway is involved in the formation of long-term memory and is thus a putative actuator of developmental disorders. According to our comprehensive transcriptomic analysis, differentiating hNPCs express Notch receptors 1-3. Here we show that similar to our previously published work after 72 h of differentiation, DAPT increases neuronal numbers to 187% and 439% of the respective solvent control at 0.12 and 10 µM DAPT, respectively, after 5 days of differentiation. Of note, the total cell number was not affected, indicating that the increase in neuronal numbers is at the expense of another cell type within the mixed culture ( Figure 4C ). The higher sensitivity of hNPC towards DAPT in this study is possibly due to the longer experimental time. Moreover, here we use different individuals compared to the previous study."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"DAPT\",\"KE\",\"increased neuronal numbers\""}]}

EGFdependent hiNPC proliferation is also EGFR-dependent since the EGFR inhibitor PD153035 decreased hiNPC proliferation ( Figure 7C ) similar to the primary hNPCs. These data demonstrate that the EGFR, as a crucial molecule for NPC proliferation, is also functioning in proliferating hiNPCs. The proliferation of hiNPCs was also effectively inhibited by rotenone, an anti-proliferative compound with a known mode of action i.e. inhibition of the mitochondrial complex I of the electron transport chain. Rotenone produced oxidative stress in iPSC-derived neural stem cells and mitochondrial dysfunction in human neural progenitor cells. In the present study, rotenone inhibited the proliferation of hiNPCs in a concentration-dependent manner with the lowest observed effect concentration of 30 nM ( Figure 7E ). In comparison, the proliferation of primary hNPCs was not affected by rotenone in the same concentration range. Rotenone did not cause cytotoxicity in hiNPCs, however as expected from a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor, significantly reduced the mitochondrial activity ( Figure 7F ).

This study also demonstrated that including both overall network activity and network coordination measures are important for stratifying compound concentration-dependent effects. However, these conclusions were based on testing only 5 compounds (acetaminophen was excluded because it produced no network effects) and effects on cell viability were not excluded from the analysis. Therefore, the much larger data set here provided an opportunity to revisit these questions in the context of a more diverse set of chemical perturbations and an additional network parameter (normalized mutual information).

These data indicate DM has neurotrophic actions. DM-induced Bdnf eIV-IX mRNAexpression through the calcineurin and ERK/MAPK pathways, the increase of which was reduced by GABAA receptor activation. Using a promoter assay, we found that Ca 2 þ -responsive elements including a CRE are involved in the DM-induced activation of the Bdnf promoter IV ( Bdnf-pIV ). The intracellular concentration of Ca 2 þ and activation of Bdnf-pIV remained elevated for, at least, 1 and 24 h, respectively. Moreover, GABAA receptor activation or a blockade of Ca 2 þ influx even after starting the incubation with DM reduced the elevated activity of Bdnf-pIV. These data demonstrated that the prolonged activation of Bdnf-pIV occurred because of this continuous increase in the intracellular Ca 2 þ concentration. Thus, DM has neurotrophic effects on neurons, likely due to prolonged activation of Bdnf promoter in neurons.

This occurred in the presence of compound exposure, which was from 2 h after plating through DIV12. By integrating data from multiple measures of network activity, it was reasoned a more comprehensive and reliable metric of network function could be defined. To this end, the total perturbation of the cortical network was defined by the sum of individual network parameter perturbations observed. In particular, the Euclidean norm of 9 network parameters was selected at each time point to equally weight values that depart from the normal range in both the positive and negative direction. This resulted in total system scalar perturbation over time trajectories that were visualized for each replicate and summarized by localized regression curves (Fig. 3). For example, the total scalar perturbation of acetaminophen remained below the shaded uncertainty range of 3× the median absolute deviation (MAD) of untreated control wells across all timepoints (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the scalar perturbation of haloperidol exposure increased with increasing haloperidol concentration and extended well past the 3× MAD limit (Fig. 3B)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Acetaminophen\",\"KE\",\"No meaningful scalar perturbation across development\""}]}

There have been many studies in the literature reporting adverse effects of such chemical compounds on environmental and human health. Exposure to some of these pesticides may lead to alterations in the genetic mate rial thereby causing mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, and immunotoxicity. Endosulfan, a broad-spectrum organochlorine pesticide is classified as hazardous both by World Health Organization and the US Environmental Protection Agency. It is persistent in the environment and bioaccumulative in organisms because of its lipophilic features. High levels of endosulfan residues have been detected in several feed such as fish and bovine milk. Endosulfan is largely used worldwide and blamed for various health problems. Neurotoxicity is thought to be the essential cause of acute endosulfan toxicity as evidenced from endosulfan poisoning cases. Subchronic exposure to endosulfan has been shown to cause prominent suppression of humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in rats. Endosulfan-induced apoptosis in human T-cells leukemic cell lines has also been reported. Chlorpyrifos is an organophosphate (OP) insecticide and has been widely used since 1965. It has been claimed that chlorpyrifos is nonteratogenic, noncarcinogenic, and does not adversely affect reproductive functions. It is well-known that OP pesticides exert their toxic effects mainly through inhibition of acetyl cholinesterase in the nervous system. Chlorpyrifos has been reported to affect chromosomes in mammalian cell cultures. However, results of various studies on the genotoxic effects of chlorpyriphos appear to be controversial."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"chlorpyrifos\",\"MIE\",\"Inhibition of acetyl cholinesterase\"\n\"endosulfan\",\"AO\",\"Suppression of humoral and cell-mediated immune responses\"\n\"endosulfan\",\"KE\",\"Apoptosis in human T-cell leukemic lines reported\"\n\"endosulfan\",\"AO\",\"Neurotoxicity linked to acute toxicity\""}]}

Few models predicting toxic effects of mixtures have effectively dealt with the influence of magnitudes of exposure and dependence on the ratios of the component chemicals. Future work determining the effects of these pesticide combinations to non-target organisms at environmentally relevant concentration is needed. We have shown that the joint inhibitory effects of mixtures of OP and CB insecticides on housefly-head AChE activity are not always dose-additive in-vitro. The concentration addition approach could severely underestimate combined toxicity of OPs where their oxon analog (metabolite) is more toxic than their parent compound. The present study has highlighted the differential toxicity of binary combinations of OP and CB pesticides under oxidised and un-oxidised conditions. Pyrethroids in combination with OPs and CBs were highly synergistic. The results from this in vitro study demonstrate environmental concern on the use of TRZ and MLT in binary combination with CBs and SPs. Increased potency of these OP, CB and SP in binary combinations could result in deleterious effects on non-target organisms. It is, however, difficult to extrapolate the in vitro effects of the single pesticides and pesticide mixtures studies to in vivo exposures. Further research examining the effect that low levels of these pesticides during in vivo exposures needs to be performed in order for environmental managers to make informed decisions."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

However, the potency of insecticides to inhibit VGCCs upon repeated exposure was comparable with the inhibition previously observed following acute exposure, with the exception of chlorpyrifos. The data suggest that an acute exposure paradigm is sufficient for screening chemicals for effects on VGCCs and that PC12 cells are a sensitive model for detection of effects on VGCCs. Key words: subchronic exposure; repeated exposure; in vitro neurotoxicology; calcium homeostasis; voltage-gated calcium channels; insecticides Insecticides are abundantly used because of their neurotoxicity to insects, but their mode(s) of action are often not restricted to insects. The widespread use of insecticides may therefore be of concern for (developmental) neurotoxicity in mammals, including humans. Insecticides are commonly classified according to their structure and best-known neurotoxic mode of action. Organochlorine insecticides are generally banned but very persistent and still present in the environment. Organochlorines are subclassified in 2 main groups: 1,1,1-Trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT)-type insecticides that target voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) and chlorinated alicyclic insecticides that target c -Aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine receptors. Pyrethroid insecticides delay the inactivation of VGSCs and thus increase the Na influx, which consequently depolarizes the cell membrane resulting in overexcitation. Organophosphate insecticides are best known for their irreversible inhibition of acetylcholine esterase (AChE), which results in increased levels of ACh and subsequent overexcitation. Bioactivation of organophosphates via the formation of oxon metabolites strongly increases their neurotoxic potency via AChE inhibition."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

The faster maturation of rodent cells compared to human cells in vitro was also suggested by Masjosthusmann et al.. As the compound set presented in Table 2 is rather small and focused on pesticides, we cannot draw general conclusions about species-specific differences in sensitivity between the rNNF and hNNF assays. As suggested by Baumann et al., testing of additional compounds with known MoAs is required to infer more general species-specific sensitivity. Nevertheless, our data highlights the importance of considering species specificities when comparing screening results. Besides the species, experimental procedures differ between the human and rat NNF assays and may also lead to differences in assay sensitivity. Two major exposure differences are crucial. First, the time point when the compound is administered differs between the hNNF and rNNF assay. Rat cortical cultures are exposed to the compound two hours after seeding the cells on MEAs, whereas the first day of dosing in hNNF experiments is DIV 7, when first single spike activities are visible. The respective networks are at different stages of development at this time, i.e., in contrast to human cells, rat cortical cells are barely established in the culture dish."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Nevertheless, the results suggest that the difference in potency of insecticides for inhibition of VGCCs between the 2 exposure conditions was generally limited and that the effects induced by a preceding subchronic exposure hardly influence the degree of inhibition of VGCCs by a repeated, acute exposure. The observed higher potency for chlorpyrifos after repeated exposure compared with acute exposure in PC12 cells are likely the result of adaptive mechanisms. As described, studies on subacute and repeated exposure to chlorpyrifos have shown persistent and permanent changes on neurotoxicological endpoints and we have demonstrated that the inhibition in VGCCs was not or slowly reversible. This suggests that adaptive mechanisms, such as gene expression, protein function, phosphorylation, or ubiquitination of VGCCs and/or changes in VGCCs turnover, may play a role in the availability, functionality, and/or binding affinity of VGCCs. However, it remains to be determined which adaptive mechanisms are involved and why particularly for chlorpyrifos an increased inhibition of VGCCs was observed after repeated exposure compared to acute exposure. Previously, we have compared the effective concentrations of the presumed primary modes of action of organophosphates, organochlorines, and pyrethroids with effective concentrations for acute inhibition of VGCCs by chlorpyrifos, endosulfan, and cypermethrin."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Direct measurements of proliferation by BrdU incorporation indicated a 78.1% decrease in BrdU incorporation in spheres growing in the absence (w/o growth factors) compared to the presence (solvent control) of growth factors ( Figure 2C ). The proliferative capacity of Lonza hNPCs was reported previously. The neurodevelopmental process of proliferation is guided by various signaling pathways including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. To elucidate if EGFR mediates this proliferative cell response in hNPC, we assessed hNPC proliferation in presence of the EGFR inhibitor quinazoline PD153035. PD153035 antagonized the EGF-induced hNPC proliferation, as assessed via BrdU incorporation and sphere size increase, without inducing cytotoxicity. This confirms that EGFR signaling regulates hNPC proliferation in vitro ( Figure 2C ). EGFR signaling generally regulates cell proliferation, growth, differentiation and cell survival. In the developing brain, the EGFR is increasingly expressed over time and is mainly found in proliferating and migratory brain regions. The EGFR is therefore indispensable for proper rodent brain development. Specifically, the proliferation of murine neural stem cells and nestin + progenitor cells was previously increased by EGFR signaling in vitro."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"PD153035\",\"KE\",\"antagonized EGF-induced proliferation\"\n\"EGF\",\"KE\",\"increased hNPC proliferation\""}]}

Pyrethroids are highly active synthetic derivatives of natural pyrethrins which are toxins found in theflowers of Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium. Since pyrethroids are rapidly metabolized in mammals and have low toxicity, they have been widely used to control insect pests in agriculture and in the home. Pyrethroid insecticides are classified into two major groups on the basis of chemical structure: type II pyrethroids with a cyano moiety at the a -position (i.e., cypermethrin and deltamethrin), and type I pyrethroids, like permethrin, without it. Pyrethroids prolong the opening of the voltage-sensitive sodium channel (VSSC) and raise a prolonged sodium tail current in mammalian as well as invertebrate neurons.

In a recent study examining sodium and calcium flux in mouse cortical neurons, bifenthrin had low efficacy in modulation of both responses. This lack of efficacy may underlie the response in the present study. However, under conditions where inhibitory GABAergic neurotransmission is blocked, bifenthrin reduced network firing rate in a concentration-dependent manner and has an IC value in the nM range. Thus, bifenthrin could be considered a false negative in the current study. The need for in vitro assays to screen chemicals for their hazard potential is well recognized. The nervous system presents unique challenges with respect to screening assays because its functional output involves spatial and temporal patterns of electrical activity that are influenced by the phenotypes of various cells that comprise different neuronal pathways. For in vitro assays based on biochemical and morphological endpoints, it is often difficult or not possible to predict how changes in these endpoints may ultimately influence neuronal function. In addition, there are many different known toxicity pathways in the nervous system that will result in significant, and sometimes fatal, toxicity outcomes prior to or in the absence of changes in protein levels or gene expression. Neurophysiology has been utilized for many decades as a sensitive indicator of chemical neurotoxicity. However, many neurophysiological approaches lack the throughput necessary to be efficient screens for neuroactivity/toxicity."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Prenatal exposure to MeHg causes severe neurological symptoms including intellectual disabilities and cerebral palsy in children. Investigations of brain autopsy samples confirmed that exposure to MeHg perturbed cell migration and disorganized neocortical layering, which was verified in animal models. Dysplasia and abnormal cortical cytoarchitecture have been attributed to a MeHgmediated genetic reprogramming of signaling pathways regulating neural development. Hence disrupting the cerebral cortical organization, disturbing migratory processes and causing heterotopia. One signaling pathway affected by MeHg exposure is the Notch receptor pathway, which controls cell fate decisions, proliferation, migration and neurite outgrowth during neural development. Moreover, MeHg disturbs the cytoskeletal organization involved in cell migration by disrupting the assembly and polymerization of microtubules. Exposure of differentiating hNPCs to MeHg resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction of RG migration at in vivo relevant concentrations ( Figure 3E adapted from Fritsche et al., Moors et al., Baumann et al. ). No cytotoxicity was observed in the tested concentration range, indicating a specific effect of MeHg on hNPC migration. As demonstrated with MeHg, the NPC2a assay is able to detect specific alterations in cell migration and therefore allows for the detection of chemically-induced disruption of migration in the context of brain development. Besides RG migration (NPC2a) the Neurosphere Assay covers the endpoints neuronal (NPC2b) and oligodendrocyte migration (NPC2c)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

The results suggest that modulations of VGCC were not specific to individual subunits of VGCC: cca -1, which is expressed in pharyngeal muscle, was specifically up-regulated in the 50 mg L treatment. Likewise, egl19, which is expressed in pharyngeal and body muscles, was significantly up-regulated at 5 mg L deltamethrin, and unc -2, which is required in the HSNs and/or VCs to negatively regulate egg-laying, was significantly up-regulated at 0.05 mg L. The results suggest that egl -19, cca -1, and unc -2 may be potential regulators of deltamethrin-dependent behaviors at different concentration of deltamethrin. Interestingly, all the three α 1-subunits of VGCC were down-regulated in C. elegans following 0.5 mg L deltamethrin exposure. It remains to be determined whether low level and chronic exposure of deltamethrin is associated to desensitization of VGCC receptors. Tofurther identify which VGCCs are involved, we selected 4 different VGCCblockers (three were L-type, one was T-type) and tested their relative nematicidal activity and effects on three α 1-subunits of VGCC expression in C. elegans. Among 4 VGCC blockers, mibefradil (T-type) demonstrated the highest lethal activity, followed by nifedipine (Ltype). Further analysis of the expression of α 1-subunits of VGCC following Ca channel blockers treatment revealed that egl -19 was signifi-cantly down-regulated at both deltamethrin and four Ca channel blockers."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"deltamethrin\",\"KE\",\"Down-regulation of egl-19, cca-1 and unc-2 at 0.5 mg L−1\""}]}

Second, it should be recognized that the primary cortical culture used here is a mixed culture consisting of excitatory and inhibitory neurons as well as glia. Therefore, these individual cell types may respond differently, and obscure the ability to detect an influential response that is not occurring in the majority of cells or in a dominant cell population. Under the protocol used here, it would not be possible to discriminate differential responses of the cell types, and small responses in a single cell type might not be large enough to reach the limits of detection/significance, which could influence the identified pathways. Similarly, the metabolomics analysis was based on media samples, not intracellular metabolites. It is possible that such an approach favored detection of metabolites more associated with cellular death or altered membrane integrity over those that might reflect other biochemical processes. The advantage of this approach is that it would lend itself to repeated metabolomic analyses over time from the same well/population of cells. Third, the concentrations tested in this study were limited, and covered a different range of responses for the different compounds. DA was tested at the lowest concentration, which was near its toxicological 'tipping point' concentration where the homeostatic compensatory processes of the cell are overwhelmed."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Oligodendrocyte differentiation is assessed with the NPC5 assay. (A) Primary hNPCs were differentiated for 5 days in differentiation medium without growth factors on PDL-laminin-coated plates. Immunocytochemical stainings were performed to identify cells of the OL lineage (O4) and cell nuclei (Hoechst33258). (B) mRNAexpression of OL lineage markers PDGFRA, CNP, GALC, PLP1 and MBP wasassessedin proliferating hNPCs and hNPC differentiated for 60 h using quantitative real-time PCR. Expression was calculated as copy numbers (CN) per CN of the reference gene ACTB multiplied by 10.000. The expression in differentiated hNPCs is displayed as fold of expression in proliferating hNPCs. Expression of all markers increased during hNPC differentiation (adapted from Klose et al. )."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Bis-I\",\"KE\",\"reduction of neurite area and subneurite length\"\n\"narciclasine\",\"KE\",\"reduction of neurite area and subneurite length\""}]}
