In addition to the negative effects of CPF on plants, there are also reports of its positive effects. At lower concentrations, it has been found to increase all growth parameters in seedlings. A research study by Parween et al. indicated that a lower dose of CPF was found to stimulate root and shoot length, and increase the nitrate reductase (NR) activity, nitrate content, and sugar-soluble protein while at higher concentrations, CPF had a significantly negative effect on all of the above parameters. After foliar application, CPF metabolism in plants occurs through hydrolysis of P-Opyridinol to 3,5,6-TCP. Literature data indicate that CPF in plants metabolizes rapidly and the first products are formed within 24-48 h after its application. Some researchers have found that the part of CPF that is metabolized to 3,5,6-TCP may remain in the plant in the form of glycoside conjugates. However, other scholars have indicated that CPF-ox is immediately formed after CPF's penetration through the roots. Furthermore, in the roots, CPF can be hydrolyzed to 3,5,6-TCP and DETP by cleavage of the phosphorus bond. CPF-ox and 3,5,6-TCP are the two main CPF degradation metabolites identified in plant leaves and roots. Studies carried out according to the ADME protocol (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) indicate that over 70% of orally administered CPF is absorbed while dermally administered CPF was well absorbed in mice (>60%) but poorly absorbed in humans (<3%)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

However, the persistent nature of PFAS exposure, characterized by long biological half-lives, mitigates the risk of reverse causality, as it reflects historical exposure profiles. Our findings offer novel insights into the protein profiles associated with PFAS exposure in young populations, contributing to a deeper understanding of the effects of PFAS in humans. Several biological processes and pathways that are highlighted in our study, including immune-related pathways, inflammatory response, JAK-STAT signaling, and bone metabolism, play important roles in various health conditions. Future studies can focus on investigating the role of specific proteins involved in these biological processes and pathways, thereby elucidating their mediation effect between PFAS and the development of various diseases, including cardiometabolic conditions, immune-related disorders, cancer, and bone-related health conditions. Our study is one of the first to evaluate the associations of PFAS exposure with cardiometabolic proteomics in Hispanic young populations. Plasma levels of PFAS were associated with broad alterations of the proteomic profiles specifically linked to disrupted immune-related functions and JAK-STAT signaling. The overlapping proteins in both cohorts associated with PFAS exposure additionally shared similar functions related to pro-inflammation, immune responses, bone metabolism, and anti-angiogenesis. Our findings provide crucial molecular-level evidence of PFAS effects in humans and propose potential biological mechanistic insights linking PFAS exposure to human diseases.

This revealed 8 AOPs linked to liver fibrosis, cholestasis and steatosis, and the associated MIE are defined by protein alkylation, LXR and inhibition of the bile salt export pump ABCB11. However, none of the AOPs are specific for immune-mediated and/or allergic hepatitis and the lack of mechanistic and clinical consideration poorly reflects the complexity of DILI. Notwithstanding, AOPs are living documents and will improve over time as updated information is effectively integrated to avoid oversimplifications. Moreover, continuous research in the underlying mechanism of DILI provides new insights which enable the construction of more detailed AOPs. We report an AOP for immune-mediated and allergic hepatitis based on comprehensive data obtained from mouse and dog diclofenac repeated-dose studies and literature findings with clinical relevance. This non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) exerts anti-inflammatory, analgesic and anti-pyretic effects through various mechanisms; however, its use can lead to adverse drug reactions including DILI.

Epidemiological studies noticed consistent results in women. The anti-estrogenic activity of phthalates acted by inhibiting estradiol production in the ovary, leading to anovulation and premature ovarian insu GLYPH<14> ciency. Higher DEHP exposure was associated with a higher risk of decreased ovarian reserve in 215 women visiting the Fertility Center at the Massachusetts General Hospital, USA. The study by Gallicchio et al. observed that the occupational exposure to EDs led to a five times higher risk of POF in hairdressers compared with control subjects limited to Caucasian women only. The possible mechanism of phthalates' action on developing POF is that DEHP can increase the FSH level, which is associated with a high rate of follicle growth and subsequent premature ovarian depletion. To conclude, the results from in vivo and epidemiological studies have shown that the exposure to some phthalates is associated with decreased levels of estradiol, decreased ovarian reserve, and anovulation. This is collectively referred to as POF. Other female reproductive disorders related to phthalate exposure are dysfunctions of puberty. This topic will be discussed in the next part of the chapter. 5.3. Phthalates Can Induce Dysfunctions of Female Puberty Phthalates can alter the onset of puberty in female experimental animals.

However, for the time being, the stability and activity of BRs requires additional research. One method of CPF degradation in soil is bioremediation with microorganisms such as Pseudomonas sp., Enterobacter, Serratia, Alcaligenes, Sphingobacterium, Gordonia, Paracoccus, and Mesorhizobium. The main breakdown products of CPF include 3,5,6-TCP and diethyl thiophosphoric acid (DETP). As endophytes, some of the listed microorganisms further promote plant growth and nullify the phytotoxicity of pesticides. Ahmad et al. reported the beneficial effects of bioremediation with Bacillus pumilus C2A1 with ryegrass phytoremediation against CPF in soil. Sanchez-Hernandez et al., on the other hand, studied the effect of L. terrestris in CPF-contaminated soil. They found that L. terrestris did not significantly affect CPF degradation but had a beneficial effect on soil enzyme activity. Recent studies indicate the use of nanomaterials to remove CPF from soils. Nowadays, nanomaterials in the form of nanotubes or nanowires have received significant interest in studies on the remediation of various pesticides (including CPF) and their real-time applications.

It does not reflect the diversity of intoxication signs found following oral administration of various pyrethroids. A well-known toxic effect associated with synthetic pyrethroids is cutaneous paresthesia observed in workers spraying esters containing an 𝛂 -cyano substituent. Paresthesia occurs as a result of a direct effect on intracutaneous nerve endings at very low pyrethroid doses. Pyrethroids without an 𝛂 -cyano group generally show the weakest physiological effect.

Here, we use cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and binding and activity assays to molecularly define how PP2A:B55 recruits p107 and Eya3 and understand how these binding interactions facilitate substrate dephosphorylation.

Chukwuka, Shubhajit Saha *, Dip Mukherjee, Priyajit Banerjee, Kishore Dhara and Nimai Chandra Saha * Abstract: Disrupted behavior and respiratory distress effects of 96-h acute deltamethrin exposures in adult Mozambique tilapia, Oreochromis mossambicus, were investigated using behavioral indices and opercular movement, respectively. Deltamethrin concentrations were found to be associated with toxicological (lethal and sublethal) responses. At 24, 48, 72, and 96 h, the LC50 values and 95% confidence limits were 12.290 (11.174-14.411 µ g/L), 12.671 (11.334-15.649 µ g/L), 10.172 (9.310-11.193 µ g/L), and 8.639 (7.860-9.417 µ g/L), respectively. The GUTS-model analysis showed that GUTS-SD (stochastic death) with a narrow tolerance distribution in deltamethrin exposed O. mossambicus populations was more sensitive than the GUTS-IT (individual tolerance) model. Prior to death, exposed fish demonstrated concentration-dependent mortality and disturbed behavioral responses, including uncoordinated swim motions, increased mucus secretion, unbalanced and unpredictable swimming patterns, and inactivity. The altered behavioral patterns and increased opercular movement with increased deltamethrin levels and exposure time are strongly suggestive of neurotoxicity and respiratory distress, respectively. Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs), describing biological mechanisms and plausible pathways, highlighted oxidative stress and cholinergic effects as intermediate steps linked to respiratory distress and behavioral toxicity.

Carboplatin was shown to require a 20 -40-fold higher concentration to observe a nephrotoxic effect, with 10-fold decreased rate of adduct formation. The potency difference could be directly related to these different rates of aquation. Oxaliplatin differs structurally from cisplatin, forming Pt-DNA adducts with its (trans-R,R)1,2 diaminocyclohexane carrier ligand, yet forms the same adducts at the same DNA sites despite differential recognition by mismatch repair and damage-recognition proteins. These DNA crosslinks induce DNA double helix disruption that inhibit DNA synthesis, replication and transcription in rapidly proliferating cells. Despite aquation occurring at slower rates, oxaliplatin induces an equal amount of DNA crosslinks to induce similar biological effects and lesions, approximately 1 -2 %. The formation of these Pt-DNA adducts cause distortions in DNA that are recognised by several cellular proteins that activate damage response pathways to induce cell cycle arrest and repair, or in cases of severe injury, cell death. 2.2.

We characterized their baseline cytokine secretion profiles and assessed their responses to LPS stimulation using a human cytokine array comprising 42 targets related to cellular inflammation. Among these three models, hiMG exhibited the most pronounced basal cytokine secretion, with ten detectable cytokines (e.g., IL-6 and TNFα ) in the array analysis, outperforming both HMC3 and IM-HM (Fig. 1a-g). Following stimulation with 100 ng/ml LPS for 24 h, hiMG demonstrated the highest increase in cytokine levels among the models assessed. Notably, six cytokines-IL-6, IL-10, CCL8 (MCP-2), CXCL5 (ENA-78), CCL5 (RANTES), and TNFα -showed significant upregulation in hiMG cells (Fig. 1b-c and supplementary Figure 1A). In contrast, HMC3 cells only displayed significant increases in IL-6 and CCL5, while IM-HM cells exhibited upregulation of IL-6, IL-7, CXCL8 (IL-8), CCL5, and CCL2 (MCP-1) (Fig. 1d-g and Supplementary Figure 1B-C). Remarkably, TNFα was exclusively expressed in hiMG in response to LPS stimulation, while both IL-6 and CCL5 levels increased across all three human microglial cell types. In contrast to human microglial cells, the murine BV2 microglial cell line exhibited a distinctly different cytokine expression profile following LPS treatment. Stimulation of BV2 cells resulted in a significant increase in eight cytokines: CSF3 (GCSF), CCL12 (MCP-5), CCL3 (MIP-1 α ), CXCL2 (MIP-2), CCL9 (MIPγ ), CCL5 (RANTES), TNFRSF1A (sTNF RI), and TNFRSF1B (sTNF RII) (Fig. 2a-c and Supplementary Figure 1D)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"LPS\",\"KE\",\"Upregulation of multiple cytokines (hiMG)\"\n\"LPS\",\"KE\",\"Increased cytokines in BV2 (mouse microglia)\"\n\"LPS\",\"KE\",\"TNF-α expressed only in hiMG among tested human microglia lines\"\n\"LPS\",\"KE\",\"Increased IL-6 in HMC3 and IM-HM (but not TNF-α)\""}]}

Thus, the p38, ERK, and JNK MAPK subfamilies are all involved in CsA nephrotoxicity. Specifically, the ERK1/2 cascade plays an important role in the CsA-induced mechanisms that generate nephrotoxicity, namely, the reduction of kidney cell paracellular permeability, ROS production, and oxidative stress. In ischemia-reperfusion injury in the kidneys, CsA protects by upregulating ERK and downregulating JNK and p38 expression. Since the MAPK signaling pathways are known to participate in many cell functions and diseases, it is likely that the MAPK pathways play other, as yet undetermined, roles in the regulation of the CsA nephrotoxicity. Since few studies have examined these pathways in CsA nephrotoxicity, deeper and more systematic analyses are warranted. CsA nephrotoxicity is characterized by renal vasoconstriction that often progresses to chronic injury with irreversible structural renal damage. Renal vasoconstriction is attributed to an imbalance in the release of vasoactive substances, including decreased production of NO. NO is generated from -arginine by NOS isoforms. There are at least three NOS isoforms, namely, neuronal NOS, inducible NOS (iNOS), and endothelial NOS (eNOS). In the kidney, NO is a vasoactive factor that plays a key role in maintaining vascular tone, in part by inhibiting the formation of endothelin, which is a peptide that constricts blood vessels."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"CsA\",\"AO\",\"Renal vasoconstriction\"\n\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"Decreased NO production attributed to vasoconstriction\"\n\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"Cytochrome c release\"\n\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"MAPK involvement (p38/ERK/JNK)\""}]}

Other data indicate that the half-life can range from 2 weeks to more than 1 year. This high interchangeability of the half-life is related to the soil properties, which include the soil type, pH, moisture, temperature, organic matter and organic carbon content, and the microbial metabolism of CPF. The degradation of CPF is increased by higher soil temperatures with lower organic matter contents and lower acidity. Another important factor is the characteristics of the chlorpyrifos-based plant protection product (e.g., its composition, surfactant content, and other auxiliary compounds) and its method of application. Literature data indicate that CPF can affect the soil microflora population and inhibit the cycling of important soil nutrients, including nitrogen fixation by bacteria. The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by CPF directly contributes to the reduction in nitrase activity by inhibiting the expression of genes related to soil nitrogen fixation. Riah et al. reported that CPF can also affect the activity of soil enzymes such as phosphatases and β -glucosidase. In addition, the metabolites generated by CPF degradation may exhibit greater toxicity than the original compound.

Therefore, possible teratogenic effects may be missed in this NAM. To circumvent the immature intrinsic CYPmediated biotransformation capacity, several research groups have been exploring using an exogenous Metabolic Activating System (MAS) based upon liver microsomes. By adding an exogenous MAS as a modular system for the zebrafish embryo assay, zebrafish embryos can be exposed to metabolically activated proteratogens during the main organogenesis period. Although CYP-mediated biotransformation in zebrafish embryos has been reasonably well characterized, there is still a knowledge gap in this species for other phase I enzymes involved in the biotransformation of xenobiotics. This information is pivotal for proteratogens needing bioactivation to exert their teratogenic potential. This study aimed to investigate whether carbamazepine (CBZ) and levetiracetam (LTC), two anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) that require bioactivation to exert their teratogenic potential, are biotransformed into non-CYP mediated metabolites in the zebrafish embryo and whether these metabolites cause developmental toxicity in this species. CBZ and LTC were selected in this study as the literature suggested that they might be biotransformed into toxic non-CYP mediated metabolites.

Thus, NFκ B is an important target molecule of CsA. NFκ B p65 can be modulated by Klotho and contributes to CsA nephrotoxicity. NFκ B is also involved in the ability of CsA to inhibit the expression of key costimulatory cell-surface molecules on DCs. CsA prolongs the survival of cardiac xenografts by suppressing NFκ B activity. Further studies on the roles of NKκ B in CsA nephrotoxicity are warranted. TGFβ 1 is afibrogenic cytokine that contributes to CsA-induced renalfibrosis. In rats with CsA nephrotoxicity, TGFβ 1 mRNA expression in the kidney was markedly increased. Upregulated renal TGFβ 1 expression was also found in patients with CsA nephrotoxicity. These data show that while CsA is well known for its ability to inhibit the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, it also stimulates TGFβ 1 expression. Moreover, this high expression of TGFβ 1 may contribute to CsA-induced renal disease. Since TGFβ 1 is afibrogenic cytokine, this suggests that blocking TGFβ 1 hyperexpression could prevent CsA-associated renalfibrosis,. Slattery et al. also hypothesized that TGFβ 1 promotes EMT in renal cells, and that this may play a major role in the development of CsA-induced renalfibrosis."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"CsA\",\"AO\",\"Renal fibrosis\"\n\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"NF-κB target and contributor\"\n\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"VEGF upregulated due to NO suppression\"\n\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"Proinflammatory signaling activation linked to TLR4\""}]}

Computational Time Analysis of the Active Learning Method. We analyzed the computation times analysis reported in Table 3. The results showed that our Table 3. Computation Time Comparison (s = Seconds) between the 6-Subsets Stack-BiLSTM with Uncertainty Sampling and the Full-Data 6-Subsets Stack-BiLSTM approach achieved faster per-iteration training times than exhaustive full-data training, while still requiring fewer labeled samples. Although the 100% trained 6-subsets stack-BiLSTM still achieved a higher MCC, training on 26.7% of the data per iteration required 4914.38 s in average compared to 9109.55 s for full-data training. Additionally, although performing multiple iterations accumulated to a longer total training time, each iteration required fewer labeled samples. This made our approach more suitable for scenarios with limited labeled data or where generating labels was costly. Similarly, prediction on the test set was faster with 26.7% of the data (146.64 s) than with the full-data training (190.12 s). Overall, these results suggest that our method not only marginally outperforms the traditional brute-force technique but also provides a more computationally resource-efficient alternative by requir ing substantially fewer labeled data and less experimental effort. 3.9.

After exposure to cisplatin, the adduct formation on nDNA is cleared by the DNA repair machinery over time, while it persists in mtDNA. Preferential binding of cisplatin to mtDNA results in the disturbance of NADH-ubiquinone reductase and perturbation of ATP generation, causing direct impairment of mitochondrial protein production, mtDNA synthesis, decreasing mitochondrial oxygen consumption and increasing mitochondrial uncoupling between oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis. In cancer cells, it was shown that cisplatin exposure induces mitochondrial ROS, which could then enhance the cytotoxic effect caused by nDNA damage. Both carboplatin and oxaliplatin have also been implicated in DNA-damage induced mitochondrial dysfunction. However, compared to cisplatin, carboplatin has a reduced capacity to impair mitochondrial protein synthesis or increase intracellular ROS, suggesting the cell death pathways activated might be more intrinsically linked to nDNA damage rather than mtDNA damage (Fig. 4). Following treatment with Pt anticancer drugs, proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs) initiate the nDNA damage response (DDR) pathway to offset the DNA damage caused by replication stress. The DDR pathway becomes activated should one or more sensor kinases, such as ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), ATM and Rad3-related (ATR), and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), detect breaks in DNA strands."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Carboplatin\",\"KE\",\"Reduced capacity to impair mitochondrial protein synthesis or increase intracellular ROS (vs cisplatin)\"\n\"Cisplatin\",\"KE\",\"Disturbance of NADH-ubiquinone reductase and ATP generation\"\n\"Carboplatin\",\"KE\",\"DNA-damage implicated mitochondrial dysfunction\"\n\"Cisplatin\",\"KE\",\"Decreased mitochondrial oxygen consumption and increased uncoupling\"\n\"Cisplatin\",\"KE\",\"Preferential binding/persistence in mtDNA\"\n\"Oxaliplatin\",\"KE\",\"Proximal tubular cell damage (less than cisplatin)\"\n\"Cisplatin\",\"KE\",\"Activation of DNA damage response (DDR) via ATM/ATR/DNA-PK sensing breaks\""}]}

Thus, there are insufficient data to assess specificity of the combined MEA/NVS\\_IC assay results for neurotoxicity. While not assessing specificity, there were 13 compounds (including the negative controls) tested in the current study that were not hits in the NVS\\_IC or MEA assays and are not recognized to cause neurotoxicity in vivo (Supplemental Table 3). Three of these compounds are highly active in ToxCast assays, including mancozeb (active in 16% of ToxCast assays), butachlor (15%) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS; 15%). Although expected to be positive, ziram (17%) and maneb (13%) were also negative in the MEA assay. This indicates that the MEA assay is not simply responding to any compound that has high biological activity. Ziram was cytotoxic but not detected as a hit in the MEA assay. This may indicate that cytotoxicity per se does not necessarily alter wMFR, but may also be a discrepancy due to testing of cytotoxicity and activity in two different assays which employ different cell densities. Future compound test sets will need to include larger numbers of negative control compounds to assess better the specificity of MEAs for larger compound sets.

Within hepatocytes, the reactive metabolites elicit cellular stress responses including oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis and ER stress/unfolded protein responses. In repeated-dose studies with mice, diclofenac treatment induced expression of the plasma membrane cysteine carrier ( Slc3a1 ) to imply adaptive responses to oxidative stress. Furthermore, cysteine is an essential building block for the hepatic synthesis of reduced GSH and therefore of fundamental importance in alleviating oxidative stresses. KE1: mitochondrial dysfunction Diclofenac caused mitochondrial dysfunction through an inhibition of ATP synthesis. The significant repression of mitochondrial membrane transport proteins and key members of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway is testimony of an impaired mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis. Conversely, the plasma membrane Mg 2+ transporter is strongly induced to increase intracellular Mg 2+ concentration. Note increased Mg 2+ uptake counteracts the detrimental effects of diclofenac treatment to alleviate mitochondrial stress and the opening of the Ca 2+ -dependent permeability transition pore to dampen apoptotic signaling.

The mechanism by which phthalates interfere with DNA methylation remains unclear. However, phthalates are known to increase the production of reactive oxygen species 43. Oxidative DNA damage could inhibit binding of methyl-CpG binding proteins and alter DNA methyltransferase function 44. Further work is needed to fully understand mechanisms that link phthalate exposure to epigenetic placental dysregulation of EGFR. Phthalate exposure has previously been associated with altered DNA methylation of growth-related genes in the term human placenta. Specifically, urinary mono (2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP), and mono (2-ethyl-5-oxyohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP) are inversely associated with placental IGF2 DNA methylation 22. These associations were determined in growth restricted infants, suggesting that changes in placental DNA methylation represent an underlying biological pathway linking prenatal phthalate exposure and IUGR 22. Our study did not find significant alterations in methylation patterns at IGF2. It is possible that epigenetic modifications of IGF2 occur later in gestation and were not evident in our first trimester placental samples. Similarly, it is possible that altered imprinting due to phthalate exposure at IGF2 is a unique pathway for IUGR.

Moreover, experimentally verifying the bioactivities of all compounds in such a large chemical space is impossible unless the efficiency of identifying compounds with the desired bioactivities can be improved. The denovo design of drug candidate compounds is expected to yield chemical structures without depending on existing compound libraries. 3 A structure generator algorithm can automatically output a chemical structure based on the initial conditions.

Omics technologies have emerged as a valuable tool in environmental epidemiology, enabling the identification of cellular-level biological signatures of environmental exposure and facilitating the development of plausible physiological mechanisms. Particularly, proteomic profiles provide crucial information about variations in the relative abundance, induction, and repression of thousands of proteins. Proteomic data serve to potentially unveil the biological functions, metabolic networks, and functional protein interaction networks of cells and organisms at a systemic level in response to an environmental exposure. Hence, functional proteins altered by environmental stressors can be selected as novel biomarkers to assess the toxicity of environmental stressors, the presence of specific compounds, and the progression of pollutant accumulation. Despite significant advancements, the use of high-throughput proteomics in environmental epidemiology is still a developing field.

Enhanced concentration of brimonidine may also result in the activation of a -ARs present on immune cells, such as macrophages and mast cells, both of which are present at increased densities in rosacea-affected skin. Known effects include an increased release of vasodilatory mediators, such as prostaglandin E, histamine, tryptase, and neuropeptides, which could in turn result in worsened erythema. The 'spillover' effect may explain paradoxical-worsening erythema following the application of brimonidine, where an initial reduction in erythema is observable prior to the saturation of vascular a -ARs. This may be followed by enhanced binding to other receptor subtypes on different cell types that override local vasoconstriction by vasodilatory and/or inflammatory mechanisms within a few hours of application. Alternatively, chronic a -AR agonism may downregulate or desensitize vasoconstrictive a 2-ARs, leading to reflexive vasodilation via vasodilatatory a -ARs.

Uncertainty in these critical concentrations was estimated by a 95% confidence interval derived from iterative random sampling and recalculation of the critical concentration with available replicates. The same compound often produced multiple tipping points depending on the time interval considered ( e.g. DIV 5 -12 vs DIV 9 -12). Tipping points with uncertainty ranges spanning two orders of magnitude or greater were discarded as unreliable estimates. These criteria applied to 9 out of the 42 compounds, but in no case did it remove all tipping point estimates for a compound (Supp Table 2). To interrogate the magnitude of tipping point concentration differences between different time windows, the fold-change between the most discordant pair of tipping point estimates was calculated for each compound with more than one estimate. The average fold-difference among the 33 compounds with multiple estimates was found to be 2.21 (Supp Table 2)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Diazepam\",\"KE\",\"Tipping point critical concentration for altered network development\""}]}

They are widely used in agricultural production because of their high efficiency, broad spectrum, low toxicity and easy degradation. However, with the extensive use of pyrethroid pesticides, the population exposure risk level is also increasing gradually. Timothy found that pyrethroids had an accumulation effect in nerve cells in vitro. There were also some studies revealed that pyrethroids could be detected in human breast milk and urine. These indicate that even if the pyrethroid residues detected in the environment are under maximum residue limit, they can accumulate in human body and eventually cause toxicity and side effects through various exposure approaches including dietary and non dietary ways, such as skin absorption system, respiratory system and digestive system. As was shown in Ravula ' s research, although the dose was far more lower than the residual level in the food, long-term exposure to pyrethroids would cause serious damage to the general physiological process and reproductive function. Therefore, researches on the interaction of pyrethroid pesticides with important proteins in humans are significant for further understanding the toxicity of pyrethroid pesticides to humans and for scientific guidance on pesticide use. In recent years, many studies have shown the reproductive toxicity of pyrethroids."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

The Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast is a recognized model in studies on the toxicity of various chemical compounds which affect mitochondrial DNA. These compounds cause a ρ-mutation which manifests it -self by the inability of the cells to grow on non-fermentable carbon sources. ρ-mutants are characterized by the de -letion of mitochondrial DNA (mDNA) and no mitochon -drial protein synthesis takes place in their mitochondria. ρmutants are also called petites, because they form smaller colonies than the wild yeast strain growth on the media containing a limited amount of glucose. ρ-mutants grown on this medium are characterized by small colonies and a whitish color, whereas non-mutant cells (ρ+) form large, beige-colored colonies. The spontaneous frequency of this mutation is rather high; about 2% of the yeast cell popula -tion consists of ρ-mutants. The loss of ability to perform oxidative phosphorylation by yeast cells is not lethal, con -trary to the cells of higher eukaryotes. studying mito -chondrial DNA mutation in higher eukaryotes is costly, and using S. cerevisiae yeast makes it possible to determine the sensitivity of mDNA to xenobiotics relatively easily. The subject of this study was the influence of pyrethroids such as deltamethrin, cypermethrin and bifenthrin on the survival rate on the cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast and the frequency of ρ-mutation in their mitochondrial DNA at the logarithmic and stationary stages of culture growth."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"bifenthrin\",\"KE\",\"mutation of mitochondrial DNA\"\n\"cypermethrin\",\"KE\",\"mutation of mitochondrial DNA\"\n\"deltamethrin\",\"KE\",\"mutation of mitochondrial DNA\"\n\"bifenthrin\",\"KE\",\"increased ρ-mutation frequency\"\n\"cypermethrin\",\"KE\",\"increased ρ-mutation frequency\"\n\"deltamethrin\",\"KE\",\"increased ρ-mutation frequency\""}]}

Details of the annotation changes are provided in the supplementary material (SI1) for reference. Relationships between KEs are typically represented as a linear pathway in AOP networks. However, it is also important to consider the potential for nonlinear or branching pathways, where a single KE may have multiple downstream influences, or else may interact with other KEs in different ways. For an accurate quantitative simulation of the AOP network, it is necessary for the network to depend on directly connected KEs. The distinction between adjacent and nonadjacent KERs was considered, resulting in the identification of a total of four nonadjacent KERs within two separate AOPs, including AOP 138 (OAT1 inhibition leading to renal failure and mortality) and AOP 186 (unknown MIE leading to renal failure and mortality). Following curation, however, it was noted that all nonadjacent KERs documented were described as adjacent in other AOPs and will be reported as such. From the selection of 13 individual AOPs outlined within Table 1, a nephrotoxicity AOP network (Fig. 1) was derived.

Of the DNT Reference compounds, 81.7% impacted network activity in this assay, suggesting that in vitro, most chemical DNT hazards act upon at least one process important to cortical network formation. This finding can be explained by the fact that many different fundamental neurodevelopmental processes must occur to lead to functional networks in vitro, including neurite outgrowth, maturation of glia, synaptogenesis, excitatory and inhibitory signaling, neurotransmitter recycling, and maintenance of electrochemical gradients. The ability to perform multiple recordings throughout the 12 DIV, as cortical networks develop and exhibit characteristic increases in activity and synchrony, is a key feature of this assay. Delays in normal network development may be just as concerning as network disruption at the final time point. Use of the AUC for summarizing network parameter values over time was favored in the analysis of these data as it captured delays in the development of network activity. Multiple compounds tested here show evidence of retarding normal network development that then recovers to normal range by DIV 12 at certain concentrations. Conservatively, those compounds should also be considered potentially hazardous because the developing network likely has to adapt in some way to compensate for the actions of the compound."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Multiple compounds\",\"KE\",\"Delay in development of network activity\"\n\"Multiple compounds\",\"KE\",\"Disrupted cortical network formation/function\"\n\"Multiple compounds\",\"KE\",\"Altered network activity and synchrony metrics\""}]}

This irreversible and dose-responsive 5FU effect on C. elegans developmental progress is consistent with rodent data showing that a single maternal 5FU exposure during gestation reduces later fetal and birth weights in a dose response manner. Continuous 5FU exposures were also associated with significant dose-response reductions in spontaneous locomotor activity at L3 and L4, and these later juvenile hypoactivity effects were only slightly reduced in the early-only exposure groups (Fig. 2 C & D). At 5 µ g/mL continuous 5FU, the highest tested concentration, spontaneous locomotor activity was reduced by about 50 % at all evaluated timepoints. At lower, but still toxic continuous 5FU exposures, there were greater reductions in locomotor activity at L2 than at L4, suggesting either adaptation over time with chronic exposures or compensatory mechanisms increasing with developmental maturity (Fig. 2 C). Fatigue and reduced physical activity are frequent side effects associated chemotherapeutics including 5FU. While C. elegans does not have an equivalent to the blood brain barrier (BBB), 5FU can cross the BBB in humans and cause injury to cells of the central nervous system.

How CsA reduces antioxidant capacity is not clear but it is possible that CsA increases the production of oxygen-free radicals or the consumption of antioxidant molecules. Interestingly, when CsA is administered to asphyxiated newborn piglets after reoxygenation, it has a neuroprotective effect: it significantly attenuates the production of hydrogen peroxide by the cerebral cortex and the cerebral oxidized glutathione levels. Notably, when Wang et al. treated intracerebral hemorrhage model rats with the antioxidant melatonin, it reduced the DNA damage, inflammation, oxidative stress apoptosis, and mitochondrial damage in the brain around the hematoma. Their in vitro study with oxygen hemoglobin-treated primary rat cortical neurons showed that melatonin prevented the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, which uncouples oxidative phosphorylation and leads to mitochondrial swelling and damage. Gill et al. also speculated that CsA may exert its neuroprotective effects in asphyxiated piglets by preventing the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening, thereby reducing oxidative stress and brain cell apoptosis and preserving energy homeostasis. The possibility that CsA can prevent mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening is supported by the recent study of Yu et al. First, when HepG2 cells or mice are treated with glucose oxidase (GOX), it not only generates ROS in the hepatic cells, it causes the cytoplasmic p53 to translocate to the mitochondria. This induces the mitochondrial permeability transition pore to open, which in turn causes the hepatic cells to undergo apoptosis."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"Mitochondrial permeability transition pores generated\"\n\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"Induces ROS and decreases glutathione\""}]}

The scientifically sound, reliable test method also has to befit-for-purpose implying that the regulatory question is known. Lab-to-lab transferability of assays has always been one crucial aspect of assay reliability.

Percentage of cell survival against deltamethrin of CYP6P7 or CYP6AA3expressing cells in the presence of 10 µM PBO was significantly decreased, compared to those without PBO ( p< 0.05). In Sf9 control cells, after normalization, percentage of cells surviving deltamethrin cytotoxicity remained similar throughout treatment with different PBO concentrations (Figure 2). Enzymatic activities of CYP6P7 and CYP6AA3 against pyrethroid, organophosphate, and carbamate insecticides were investigated using CYP6P7 or CYP6AA3 reconstituted with their redox partner enzyme, the NADPH-dependent cytochrome P450 reductase. As shown in Figure 3 CYP6P7 and CYP6AA3 showed enzymatic activities toward permethrin, cypermethrin and deltamethrin, but no detectable activities were observed with bioallethrin, chlorpyrifos, and propoxur. Moreover, in contrast to CYP6AA3, CYP6P7 had undetectable enzyme activity in metabolizing λ -cyhalothrin. These results were thus in agreement with the ability of CYP6P7 and CYP6AA3 in protecting cells against cytotoxic effects of test insecticides. The results of this study showed that expression of CYP6P7 and CYP6AA3 could help protecting insect Sf9 cells from cytotoxicity of several pyrethroids. Presence of PBO diminished CYP6P7 and CYP6AA3mediated cytoprotection of Sf9 cells against deltamethrin cytotoxicity, suggesting that cytoprotection against pyrethroids was due to CYP6P7 and CYP6AA3 enzymes.

To tackle this issue, Crofton et al. provided a set of 15 principles aiming to enhance assay amenability to higher throughput screening. The establishment of the hNNF assay in this study was realized by considering these principles, which are described in more detail in the following (P1-15). During early brain development, neurons start to mature and build connections via synapses. Neural network formation and function is therefore a key aspect of neurodevelopment (P1 'Key event of neurodevelopment'). By measuring extracellular local field potentials on MEAs, network formation and function can be assessed, thus providing information on electrical activity, firing patterns, and synchronicity of the neural networks (P2 'Endpoint measurement'). By calculating the AUC for each concentration and normalizing the values to the respective solvent control, the hNNF assay can reflect alterations of network activity in both directions (increase and decrease; P3 'Dynamic range'). Furthermore, Crofton et al. emphasize the importance of parametric controls, meaning parameters of the assay that evoke predictable changes in the endpoint (P4 'Parametric controls'). One aspect that was confirmed within the presented study is the increase in electrical activity and synchronicity of the networks with increasing culture time (Fig. 3). Furthermore, Saavedra and colleagues showed that an excitatory:inhibitory (ex:inh) ratio of 70:30 using SynFire neurons exhibits the steadiest spiking increase and coverage of electrodes over differentiation time compared to other ex:inh ratios."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

OLs derive from NPCs and RG cells differentiating into oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and terminally into premyelinating OLs (pre-OLs) and myelin-producing mature OLs. The OL-derived myelin ensheathing neuronal axons is indispensable for the development and function of the human brain (reviewed in Barateiro et al. ). However, both pre-OLs and myelinating OLs are susceptible to various stressors including oxidative stress, astrogliosis, excitotoxicity and inflammation (reviewed in van Tilborg et al. ) rendering them susceptible to a variety of exogenous stressors. Disturbances in oligodendrogenesis during neurodevelopment are associated with hypomyelination and white-matter deficits manifesting in clinical pathologies including the Allan-Herndon-Dudley Syndrome and periventricular leukomalacia. Since the pool of OLs in humans remains stable after childhood, especially interference in OL development during the neurodevelopmental period is crucial. The generation of pre-myelinating OLs can be modelled in hNPCs in vitro (NPC5). Differentiation of hNPCs over 5 days generated cells expressing the OL-marker O4, which exhibit the typical OL morphology with multiple branched processes necessary to ensheath neuronal axons ( Figure 5A )."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Furthermore, beta-nitrostyrene and 3,3,4,4-tetrachlorotetrahydrothiophene 1,1-dioxide also displayed the capability to slightly elevate both IL-6 and TNFα levels in hiMGs (>10 % activity), indicating a weak cytokine response from microglia compared to LPS (Fig. 5h-i and Supplementary Table 2).

Thus, this study provides an assay platform for IL-6 and TNFα -based high-throughput neuroinflammation detection utilizing hiMG for assessing chemicals that could potentially trigger neuroinflammation. Recent studies increasingly highlight the association between exposure to neurotoxic substances and the onset or exacerbation of neuroinflammation, which can progress to neurodegeneration.

Examples of the data used to develop the AUC values are shown in Figure 2.

To increase the throughput potential of this method, we scaled the method to perform in a 96-well plate so that it could test 10 chemicals over eight concentrations in a single plate while also retaining quality control wells.

This was decided because alamarBlue and CFDA-AM solutions can be combined and applied to cells as one solution, which represents a more resource-efficient option.

In specific, the pro-inflammatory chemokines and their receptors play a major role in cytotoxic T-cell activation and the trafficking of inflammatory immune cells (neutrophils, leukocytes, B-lymphocytes) to sites of injury. In addition, MAPK signaling molecules were induced in response to diclofenac treatment and their regulation can be triggered by cellular stress and pro-inflammatory cytokines to result in inflammation-mediated hepatotoxicity. Importantly, increased expression of TNF family members activates NF-κB, JNK, p38, and ERK1/ERK2 signaling and are involved in T-cell and T-helper (Th1, Th2 and Th17) cell-mediated responses and hepatic inflammation, whereas significant repression of the LY6 antigen indicates adaptive response to cytokineinduced inflammation. Collectively, the cytokines and chemokines bind and activate their corresponding receptors to promote immune-mediated inflammation of the liver. The biological plausibility of KERs is summarized in supplementary Table S4 and Fig. 3 provides a simplified AOP for diclofenac-induced immune-mediated and allergic hepatitis. A long-term prospective clinical trial involving 17,289 arthritis patients who were randomly assigned to diclofenac (150 mg daily) or etoricoxib (60 or 90 mg daily) evidenced diclofenac to cause common aminotransferase elevations.

To extend these findings to a human fibrosis model, we used human PCLS treated with a pro-fibrotic cocktail, where AD-214 was antifibrotic, reducing collagen deposition. Interestingly, in both models AD-214 performed better than the standard of care drugs for IPF, pirfenidone (not tested in the PCLS model) and nintedanib, suggesting that AD-214-mediated blockade of CXCR4 may have superior therapeutic effects. A limitation of the PCLS studies is that we did not explore more translationally relevant doses of AD-214 and nintedanib. The 1 µM dose used in the current study is ~10× higher than the Cmax for nintedanib (standard 150 mg oral dose achieves 37-74 nM), versus 2× lower than the Cmax for AD-214 at a clinically viable IV dose (10 mg/kg). This difference would be further amplified if total exposure is considered. The half-life is 9-12 h for nintedanib and ~48 h for AD-214. Thus, we would hypothesize that titration of AD-214 and nintedanib to concentrations reflecting their in vivo PK, AD-214 would be more efficacious in the PCLS assay, and the same would be true for the bleomycin model where 60 mg/kg daily nintedanib only showed a trend for efficacy, whereas 10-30 mg/kg of AD-214 every 2 to 4 days led to a statistically significant reduction in lung fibrosis."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Nintedanib\",\"AO\",\"Trend toward reduced collagen in PCLS, not significant\""}]}

Although OPs share a common mechanism of action, assessing cumulative risk from exposures to OP mixtures remains a challenge. In parallel to human health, OP mixture toxicity remains an important consideration for the conservation of non-target, non-mammalian species. Assessing the effects of mixtures of contaminants is an issue of high priority by many governmental agencies around the world.

These tools are used to better understand how chemicals impact human health. In this study, a four-step workflow was used to derive the AOP network of human female reproductive toxicity (HFRT-AOP) from five AOPs available in the AOP-Wiki and ten AOPs obtained from the literature. Standard network analysis identified key events (KEs) that are point of convergence and divergence, upstream and downstream KEs, and bottlenecks across the network. To map di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) to the HFRT-AOP network, we extracted DEHP target genes and proteins from the Comparative Toxicogenomic and the CompTox Chemicals Dashboard databases. Enriched GO terms analysis was used to identify relevant biological processes in the ovary that are DEHP targets, whereas screening of scientific literature was performed manually and automatically using AOP-helpFinder. We combined this information to map DEHP to HFRT-AOP network to provide insight on the KEs and system-level perturbations caused by this endocrine disruptor and the emergent paths. This approach can enable better understanding of the toxic mechanism of DEHP-induced human female reproductive toxicity and reveal potential novel DEHP female reproductive targets for experimental studies."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

While the Ames test has a high positive predictivity for genotoxicity, some genotoxic chemicals are false negatives, likely due to bacterial differences from humans in factors such as uptake, metabolic activation, chromosome structure and DNA repair processes. A negative Ames test result does not rule out genotoxicity in humans, and carcinogens that act by nongenotoxic mechanisms are not detected by the test, yet ' it is still important to perform the bacterial reverse mutation test ' due to its high positive predictivity within a limited context-of-use. The Ames test example suggests how alternative toxicity test models with high positive detection rates for specific types of adverse outcomes can be used within regulatory frameworks as indicators of chemical hazard rather than as definitive evaluations of safety.

Unlike bacteria, C. elegans utilize conserved eukaryotic machinery for DNA packaging, epigenetic modification, replication, repair, and transcription, as well as mRNA modification and translation.

These findings suggest that nicotine intake and cholinesterase inhibitors may reduce Aβ accumulation and improve AD symptoms. Studies in rat microglia and transgenic mice showed positive effects from nicotine or cholinesterase inhibitors, while the knock out of α7 nAChR, or the use of antagonists or antibodies targeting the receptor, diminished these benefits or worsened pathology. However, in AD patients, cholinesterase inhibitors have shown only limited cognitive improvements, primarily in the early stages of the disease, and their effects are often restricted by cholinergic side effects. Regarding nicotine and its effect on AD, the picture is less clear.

In conclusion, the results from in vitro and epidemiological studies have shown that phthalate exposure is associated with an increased risk of cancer in female reproductive cells and organs. Taken together, the available data have suggested that phthalate exposure in females can lead to reproductive disorders, such as POF, decreased fecundity, adverse pregnancy outcomes, gynecological cancer, or a modulation of pubertal onset and pubertal symptoms in girls. Altered reproductive health can be influenced by phthalates' impact on the hormonal system. The next chapter is focused on the hormonal mechanisms of phthalates' action. 6.

What is the initiating event that has CsA at the epicentre in this context? All these questions are quite important for the fully understanding of the mechanism of oxidative stress in the CsA nephrotoxicity. The proposed mechanism by which oxidative stress contributes to CsA nephrotoxicity is shown in Fig. 2. 4. Role of autophagy in CsA nephrotoxicity Autophagy is a lysosomal degradation pathway that is essential for survival, differentiation, development, and homeostasis. While it helps to protect organisms against pathologies such as infections, cancer, neurodegeneration, aging, and heart disease, its ability to digest cellular components and even its prosurvival functions can be detrimental to the cell or organism in certain experimental settings. Several lines of evidence show that autophagy participates in the pathogenesis of nephrotoxicity. For example, when Song et al. treated rat tubular cells with lead, which is a known nephrotoxicant, it blocked autophagy by inducing lysosomal membrane permeabilization, thereby impairing the function of the lysosomes. Moreover, when kidney cells are treated with two natural compounds, namely, alisol A 24-acetate and alisol B 23-acetate, the PI3K/Akt/ mTOR signaling pathway is inhibited. Since this pathway suppresses autophagy, the natural compounds appeared to accelerate autophagy: this excessive autophagic activity eventually led to the apoptotic death of the kidney cells. Therefore, it seems that CsA activates oxidative stress and autophagy. Autophagy in this context attenuates or promotes the CsA nephrotoxicity. 4.1. CsA-induced autophagy may protect against CsA nephrotoxicity"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

To conclude, phthalates are man-made chemicals used in the plastic industry. There are several ways to be exposed to phthalates, mainly via inhalation, ingestion, and transplacental transition. Phthalates belong to the chemicals known as EDs. They modulate the hormonal balance of the matured organism as well as the developing organism.

Our data corroborates with the reported dyslipidemic effects of toxic dosages of Tac exposure. Patients with diarrheal illness may demonstrate variability and potential toxicity following Tac exposure. However, in our study, the authors observed no significant metabolite alterations within the intestine. Tac metabolism is regulated by the CYP3A enzyme system, and occurs mostly in the small intestine, liver, and kidney. The upper small intestine is the primary site for CYP3A4-based first-pass metabolism in humans, which may explain the metabolic alternation in the intestine. However, additional studies are warranted to validate our results. Post transplanted diabetes is among the most severe Tacmediated adverse effects. It is brought on by β-cell apoptosis, diminished insulin gene expression, and direct toxicity to the islets of Langerhans. Tac-mediated islet toxicity is most frequent during solid organ transplantation, and it has a prevalence of newly developed diabetes following transplant of up to 30% within the first year. Our study uncovered several carbohydrate metabolite alterations in multiple tissues, namely, D-fructose, D-glucitol in the serum, D-Fructose in the heart, D-glucitol in the liver, and D-glucose in the kidney.

Normalized mutual information is a measure of synchrony that scales with increasing complexity of a network. Although the low correlation coefficients and PCA results suggest the 17 network parameters are largely nonredundant and quantify different aspects of network development (Supplementary Figure 1), the machine-learning results indicate that if only a few parameters were to be quantified, a combination of a sensitive measure of network activity with a measure of network coordination would be most effective in marking network functional loss. This result is consistent with our previous, more limited examination of network parameter sensitivity and reaffirms the hypothesis that a measure of overall network activity alone (eg, mean firing rate) would be insufficient to identify major functional changes due to chemical exposures. To be clear, this RFA was designed to evaluate the utility of measuring multiple parameters of network function, not to be a prediction model for effects of any given chemical on network function. Importantly, our results also indicate that consideration of all 17 parameters will provide the most sensitivity in identification of compounds disrupting network development.

Disturbances in both directions (promotion or inhibition) are considered as adverse and are associated with depressive mood disorders and intellectual disabilities. Oligodendrocyte differentiation (NPC5) and thyroid hormone-dependent oligodendrocyte maturation (NPC6) are indispensable for the insulation of neuronal axons with disturbances causing demyelination diseases like leukomalacia that severely affect neuronal functioning. Besides these DNT-relevant neurodevelopmental KEs, the Neurosphere Assay assesses the mitochondrial function and detects cytotoxicity upon chemical exposure to discriminate specific from unspecific effects ( Figure 1 ). All individual test method evaluations are automated, and concerning the experimental procedures, i.e. most pipetting steps are performed by a liquid handling system. The NPC2-5 assays are multiplexed. Quantification of differentiated neurons and oligodendrocytes is achieved by automated image analyses of immunostained cells that migrate out of the spheres in 96-well plates using convolutional neuronal networks. All endpoints are then analyzed using the Omnisphero software. This automated endpoint evaluation system allows an investigator bias-free, objective and low hands-on-effort identification of specific brain cells that used to be only possible by manual counting.

For this, animals have divided into four different groups and each group contained 10 animals (5 males and 5 females). Group I served as a control group and groups II, III, and IV were represented as experimental groups and treated with CYP at doses of 25, 50, and 75 mg/kg body weight/ day/rat, respectively. Through the behavioral results of this study, it was observed that cypermethrin intoxication causes dosedependent moderate to high toxicity symptoms like vomiting, decreased food consumption, thick eye discharge, rolling, tremors, loss of coordination, tilted neck, and convulsion attacks. A significant reduction in body weight of high-dose (75 mg)-treated animals, especially in females, was noticed. Similarly, hematological data also revealed that CYP exposure caused a reduction in the level of Hb, RBC, WBC, neutrophil, and other blood indices such as PCV and MCV and an increase in the lymphocyte percentage in both male and female experimental groups. Microscopic observation stated that CYP produced infiltration of cells near the central vein, hepatocyte degeneration, congestion of the central and portal veins, hemorrhage, and necrosis in liver tissue."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"cypermethrin\",\"AO\",\"Vomiting\"\n\"cypermethrin\",\"AO\",\"Decreased food consumption\"\n\"cypermethrin\",\"AO\",\"Thick eye discharge\"\n\"cypermethrin\",\"AO\",\"Tremors\"\n\"cypermethrin\",\"AO\",\"Convulsion attacks\"\n\"cypermethrin\",\"AO\",\"Loss of coordination\"\n\"cypermethrin\",\"AO\",\"Tilted neck\"\n\"cypermethrin\",\"KE\",\"Increased lymphocyte percentage\"\n\"cypermethrin\",\"AO\",\"Rolling behavior\"\n\"cypermethrin\",\"KE\",\"Liver: thickening/congestion of central and portal veins\"\n\"cypermethrin\",\"KE\",\"Liver: hepatocyte degeneration\"\n\"cypermethrin\",\"KE\",\"Liver: inflammatory cell infiltration near central vein\"\n\"cypermethrin\",\"KE\",\"Liver: necrosis\""}]}

Carboplatin-induced dose-dependent kidney toxicity and oxidative stress, demonstrated by increases of glutathione disulfide and lipid peroxidation with parallel decreases in antioxidant enzyme activity, have also been reported. Yet, whilst the occurrence of oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of Pt drug-induced nephrotoxicity is well documented, there remains varying explanations as to its sources. As the predominant nephrotoxic variant of the Pt drugs, several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the processes involved in ROS-induced oxidative stress within cisplatin nephrotoxicity. First, following its bioactivation, cisplatin rapidly reacts with thiol-containing molecules to diminish intracellular antioxidant levels, such as GSH. Depletion of GSH is known to induce oxidative stress within cells and elevated GSH has been observed in cisplatin-resistant cells. Second, cisplatin damages mitochondria and impairs the respiratory chain resulting in superfluous ROS production that affects antioxidant enzymes. In one study, ROS was generated when the activity of mitochondrial respiration complexes I-IV was reduced by 15 -55 %. Third, cisplatin utilises the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system to generate microsomal ROS. Cisplatin may reduce CYP activity, thereby increasing catalytic iron in the kidney. Inhibition of CYP using piperonyl butoxide prevented cisplatin-induced loss of CYP enzymes and reduced aggregation of iron in the kidney. Furthermore, the accumulation of ROS induced by cisplatin was reduced in CYP2E1-null mice, safeguarding them from cisplatin-induced AKI. 2.6."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Carboplatin\",\"KE\",\"Apoptotic cell death via ROS accumulation\"\n\"Carboplatin\",\"KE\",\"Dose-dependent kidney toxicity and oxidative stress markers\"\n\"Cisplatin\",\"KE\",\"CYP involvement; CYP inhibition reduces iron aggregation and ROS accumulation\"\n\"Carboplatin\",\"KE\",\"Oxidative stress (decreased GSH/GSSG ratio)\"\n\"Cisplatin\",\"KE\",\"Lipid peroxidation accumulation (cisplatin-induced AKI progression)\"\n\"Cisplatin\",\"KE\",\"Reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and ATP depletion\"\n\"Carboplatin\",\"KE\",\"Nephrotoxicity (less than cisplatin) and AKI occurrence\""}]}

The current study utilized concepts for assay development that were outlined by Crofton et al. Specifically, TTX and BIC were evaluated as assay-specific control compounds based on their known mechanisms of action. The network response to TTX was a consistent loss of network spiking activity, indicating that this compound is a good in-plate control for inhibition of activity. By contrast, responses to BIC were not consistent, even though the overall net effect of this compound was to increase activity and it was detected as a ''hit'' by the criteria used for these studies. However, by making some minor alterations in the tissue culture methods (addition of a step filtering cells prior to plating), increases in MFR following BIC (25 m M) are more consistent (53/54 wells increased MFR; unpublished data). As such, evaluation of BIC as an in-plate control that increases MFR is ongoing. To evaluate the ability of mwMEAs to screen for effects on neuronal network function, a training set of 23 compounds was selected and tested at a single concentration."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

In many works, it was observed that the toxicity of these compounds resulted, to a great extent, from the high doses used, which significantly affected the genotoxic potential and endocrine system and/or inhibited AChE activity in erythrocytes. Although CPF has been withdrawn from the EU market, this does not mean that humans will not be exposed to it in the future. Therefore, continuous monitoring of the residues of CPF in food and the environment is important in order to prevent this compound from ever reaching EU markets with imported products. Furthermore, it is necessary to continue research to determine the changes occurring at the cellular and tissue level in humans and animals at all stages of life and to investigate how it will affect the body several years after exposure to CPF.

Few models predicting toxic effects of mixtures have effectively dealt with the influence of magnitudes of exposure and dependence on the ratios of the component chemicals. Future work determining the effects of these pesticide combinations to non-target organisms at environmentally relevant concentration is needed. We have shown that the joint inhibitory effects of mixtures of OP and CB insecticides on housefly-head AChE activity are not always dose-additive in-vitro. The concentration addition approach could severely underestimate combined toxicity of OPs where their oxon analog (metabolite) is more toxic than their parent compound. The present study has highlighted the differential toxicity of binary combinations of OP and CB pesticides under oxidised and un-oxidised conditions. Pyrethroids in combination with OPs and CBs were highly synergistic. The results from this in vitro study demonstrate environmental concern on the use of TRZ and MLT in binary combination with CBs and SPs. Increased potency of these OP, CB and SP in binary combinations could result in deleterious effects on non-target organisms. It is, however, difficult to extrapolate the in vitro effects of the single pesticides and pesticide mixtures studies to in vivo exposures. Further research examining the effect that low levels of these pesticides during in vivo exposures needs to be performed in order for environmental managers to make informed decisions."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Distinguishing profiles of chemical-mediated changes in hormone levels can be useful for hypothesizing mechanisms of action for steroidogenesis disruption. PRO, an imidazole fungicide, is the best characterized and most widely used reference chemical for steroidogenesis studies. PRO potently inhibits the hydroxylase activity of CYP17A1 resulting in the inhibition of androgen production. The CYP17A1 enzyme is responsible for 2 steps in the steroidogenesis pathway catalyzing both a hydroxylation and 17, 20-lyase reaction. In our study, PRO significantly altered the levels of 8 of the 10 hormones evaluated (Figure 2). More specifically, the levels of PROG and DOC, which precede CYP17A1 hydroxylase activity were increased relative to DMSO controls, while all hormones produced as products of CYP17A1 activity were significantly decreased or unchanged."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"PRO\",\"KE\",\"Inhibition of androgen production\"\n\"PRO\",\"MIE\",\"CYP17A1 hydroxylase inhibition\"\n\"PRO\",\"KE\",\"Decreased downstream steroid hormones requiring CYP17A1 activity\"\n\"PRO\",\"KE\",\"Significant alteration of multiple steroid hormones\"\n\"PRO\",\"KE\",\"Increased progesterone and deoxycorticosterone\"\n\"atrazine\",\"KE\",\"Increased 17β-estradiol in vitro\""}]}

We propose the following could contribute to erythema after application: (1) local inflammation and perivascular inflammatory cells with abnormally functioning ARs may lead to vasodilatation; (2) abnormal saturation and cells expressing different AR subtypes with varying ligand affinity; (3) barrier dysfunction and increased skin concentrations of brimonidine with increased actions at endothelial and presynaptic receptors, resulting in increased vasodilation; and (4) genetic predisposition Rosacea is a chronic inflammatory disease with transient and non-transient redness as key characteristics. Brimonidine is a selective a 2-adrenergic receptor (AR) agonist approved for persistent facial erythema of rosacea based on significant efficacy and good safety data.

Approximately 80% of patients treated with brimonidine experience a significant improvement without erythema worsening as an adverse event.

The simultaneous addition of Bay K8644 with DM markedly enhanced the Bdnf eIV-IX mRNA expression, compared to the increase induced by Bay K8644 only. This effect of combined DM þ Bay K8644 is likely due to an easier accessibility of Bay K8644 to sites within L-VDCC molecule, which could be induced by depolarization via the action of DM on VSSC.

Pesticide exposure has different acute and chronic effects, including cancer, asthma, diabetes, and neurodegeneration. One of the main mechanisms underlying reasons of pesticide toxicity is oxidative stress. Pesticides have induced oxidative stress mechanisms in relation with diseases, and this is still a question of debate. Oxidative stress is a cellular homeostatic imbalance between ROS and antioxidants. While ROS increases in the cell, ROS products interact with important cellular molecules and cause detrimental effects in the cell that bring about several different diseases.

In addition, increasing lines of evidence suggest that the immunosuppressive effects as well as the main side effects of CsA may reflect extensive changes in the cellular Ca 2+ pathway. It is noteworthy that CsA is a typical calcineurin (Ca 2+ -calmodulin-activated phosphatase) inhibitor. Whether the CsA-induced Ca 2+ signaling is involved in the inhibition of calcineurin is not fully understood. Kuwana et al. showed that when mice are treated with the nephrotoxin cisplatin, Akt connects with PI3K to mediate the renal tubular injury. Chen et al. also found evidence that Akt participates in CsA nephrotoxicity. Thus, when human proximal tubular epithelial cells were treated with CsA, they exhibited EMT along with elevated microRNA-21 expression. Transfection with the microRNA-21 precursor rapidly increased phosphorylated Akt expression and downregulated PTEN expression. While CsA also downregulated Smad7 downregulation and upregulated TGFβ 1 in the renal cells, such changes were independent of microRNA-21. These changes were also observed in a mouse model of CsA-induced allograftfibrosis. Therefore, microRNA-21 may mediate CsA nephrotoxicity via the PTEN/Akt signaling pathway. The Akt pathway may also contribute to the increased propensity of organ-transplant recipients to develop skin cancers such as basal cell carcinomas and SCCs.

The number of chemicals identified as having effects on hormone levels is not altogether surprising as the chemical inventory was selected in part based on potential endocrine-activity, and our selection criteria were intended to be inclusive for screening purposes to minimize false negatives. Additionally, the current screening effort profiles a larger portion of the steroidogenic pathway than ever before (ie. 10 hormones quantified rather than ESTRADIOL and TESTO only), inherently resulting in a larger number of chemicals having any effect on hormone levels as additional mechanisms of action can be detected. However, it is also important to note that chemicals not selected for CR evaluation should not be considered as inactive for disruption of steroidogenesis as the selection process was based on a combination of activity in MTC screen and overall testing efficiency. Given the number of hormones measured, the reproducibility across studies, and the distinct profiles observed, our results suggest that it is unlikely that chemicals not selected for the CR stage have a significant effect on steroidogenesis.

As a neurotransmitter functioning between the gut and the central nervous system, CPF plays a major role in maintaining gut homeostasis, including absorption, the gut microbiota, the immune system, and motility. Obesity is not only simply excessive fat accumulation; it is also associated with lowgrade chronic inflammation, which is the main factor inducing insulin resistance. This was confirmed by the research studies conducted by Peris-Sampedro et al. on farm animals exposed to CPF. They showed that these animals may develop hyperinsulinemia and hyperlipidemia, so obesity can develop. In addition, in vitro and in vivo research conducted by Condette et al. indicated the possibility of disorders of the intestinal epithelial cell zonula occludens-1, which increases intestinal permeability and plasma lipopolysaccharide levels. Liang et al. observed that CPF-fed mice had a higher fasting glucose and insulin concentration compared to the respective control groups, suggesting that CPF may induce insulin resistance and disrupt glucose homeostasis, thereby causing obesity and increasing the risk of developing chronic diseases, e.g., type 2 diabetes.

Finally, genetic research has identified single nucleotide polymorphisms in the CHRNA7 gene, which encodes α7 nAChR subunits, as being linked to an increased risk of schizophrenia. Beyond their role in neurotransmission and previously described involvement in glial function, α7 nAChRs may also contribute to schizophrenia pathophysiology through their effects on glial cells. Glial cell loss is a key feature of schizophrenia histopathology, with deficits in oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and microglia contributing to impaired synaptic connectivity, neurotransmitter regulation and neuroimmune responses. Dysregulated α7 signalling may impair microglial homeostasis, leading to excessive synaptic pruning and the connectivity deficits observed in schizophrenia. Similarly, oligodendrocytes express α7 nAChRs, and their function in cholinergic modulation of myelination suggests that α7 dysfunction could contribute to the myelination deficits reported in schizophrenia. Finally, astrocytes rely on α7 signalling to regulate glutamate uptake and extracellular homeostasis, and impaired receptor function may lead to glutamate dysregulation, excitotoxicity and neuronal instability. These findings suggest that dysfunction of α7 nAChRs in glial populations may play a role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and that targeting these receptors in glial cells could represent an alternative strategy for cognitive enhancement beyond direct neuronal effects. 6 | Therapeutic Targeting of α7 nAChRs in AD and Schizophrenia"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Similarly, cisplatin also induces phosphorylation and consequent translocation of nuclear transcription factor-kappa B (NFκ B) to the nucleus. Upon activation, NFκ B promotes transcription of TNF α and other inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 β, IL-6, IL-18). Inflammation has been reported in the pathophysiology of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity, with a vast array of cytokines and chemokines implicated in the robust inflammatory response associated with cisplatin-induced AKI. Nephrotoxic models of cisplatin AKI have presented structural and functional changes to the tubular endothelium that attract immune cells to infiltrate damaged kidney tissue. Increased chemokine and cytokine production in response to cisplatin-induced kidney injury further upregulates adhesion molecules that attract the inflammatory cells of the immune system, such as T cells, macrophages, mast cells and dendritic cells. Alternatively, cisplatin-induced DNA damage also activates poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1), promoting apoptosis and upregulation of TNF α, IL-1b and IL-6. PARP1 inhibition or genetic deletion was shown to significantly reduce or completely eliminate cisplatin-induced AKI and inflammation. Currently, most evidence of carboplatin and oxaliplatin-induced inflammation comes from patient-specific renal biopsies. Hence, more research would be required to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that contribute to the inflammatory response reported to follow administration of these two drugs. 2.8.

In this study we thus used only uninfected Sf9 cells as control in MTT assays, and cells treated with DMSO solvent alone was a negative control. CYP6P7 or CYP6AA3-expressing cells and control Sf9 cells were seeded at 2 x 10 cells per well in 24-well culture plates. Cells were allowed to attach to wells for 3 hours, insecticides ranging from 0.1 to 500 µM final concentrations were subsequently added into each well and cells were left exposing to each insecticide for 72 hr. When insecticides were used at higher concentration than 500 µM, they were precipitated in culture media, particularly for pyrethroids. Thus concentrations of pyrethroids over 500 µM were not evaluated in MTT assays. Following insecticide treatment, culture media were removed and each well was washed twice with Luckhoff's buffer (132 mM NaCl, 3.5 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM MgCl2, and 20 mM HEPES).

Owing to the high cost involved in performing substance screening in the assay, it was not possible to distinguish between training and test set of chemicals during the establishment process. Instead, we selected pesticides that have a different DNT potential according to several in vivo and in vitro studies. Pyrethroids, for example, are connected to neurodevelopmental disorders during childhood after pyrethroid pesticide exposure in epidemiological studies. Especially deltamethrin is a thoroughly studied type II pyrethroid, for which animal studies reported long-term effects on the brain, which was also observed in vitro. In contrast, the neonicotinoid dinotefuran was described as DNT negative in vivo and also recommended as a negative tool compound for alternative DNT test methods. In the future, the hNNF assay will be challenged with more chemicals that are well-described DNT positive and negative compounds to assess specificity and sensitivity of the assay and to enhance the readiness of the test method. Currently, the academic setup of the hNNF assay allows parallel testing of 12 compounds (n = 1) within the 35-day experimental period.

Taken together, the current data indicate that primary cortical neurons may not be sufficiently sensitive to reliably detect effects on VGCCs by insecticides. However, for the measurement of, eg, electrical activity, spontaneously active primary cultures, such as primary cortical neurons, are preferred.

In conclusion, our data (together with other studies) demonstrate that VGCCs are an important target for screening insecticides (and other chemicals) for neurotoxicity. Inhibition of VGCCs could be part of a battery of functional in vitro neurotoxicity tests. Furthermore, our data indicate that investigation of effects of acute exposure to chemicals is generally sufficient to detect insecticide (or chemical)-induced inhibition of VGCCs. However, some differences in potency of insecticides for inhibition of VGCCs were observed between the exposure scenarios, which argues for the inclusion of repeated exposure conditions for specific studies."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Two AOP network case studies, namely the AOP network for metabolic disorders mediated by hepatic steatosis and the AOP network related to disruption of the thyroid axis, followed by the CYP19-AOP and T4-AOP networks nicely illustrate the concept, development, and application of the AOP networks. These studies further catalyzed the development of AOP networks for human neurotoxicity and hepatotoxicity, and the AOP network relevant to nanomaterials. All these derived AOP networks further solidify the potential of AOP networks to address the knowledge gaps, prioritize the testing strategies, and support hazard characterization and chemical risk assessment.

This hiPSC-based test system provides an unlimited cell source that is thoroughly characterized in a quality-controlled banking process that contributes to increasing the reproducibility of the test results. Furthermore, since iPSCs are reprogrammed from somatic cells (e.g.fibroblasts), the cell source raises fewer ethical concerns regarding its derivation process than primary cell material. However, hiNPCs represent a more immature developmental stage than fetal NPCs, hence they also have distinct applicability domains concerning neurodevelopmental timing. Here we present the scientific basis for the individual NPC test methods. That the endpoints tested with the Neurosphere Assay are biologically indispensable for normal brain development (biological plausibility) was described in detail earlier. Therefore, we now focus on the morphology of the different neural cell types, the expression of cell type-specific markers, the responses of the neurodevelopmental processes to physiological stimuli by using signaling pathway modulators and the predictive power to identify adverse effects of known DNT compounds. Together with the biological relevance of the endpoint, thesefive aspects build the scientific basis of the Neurosphere Assay. Test compounds applied for the validation process are summarized in Table 1. Details for each specific assay are described below. 2.2 Basic hNPC and hiNPC Cell Culture Primary human NPCs (hNPCs) were isolated from cortices of gestational week 16 -19 fetuses and purchased from Lonza Verviers SPRL, Belgium (#PT-2599).

As another measure of assay performance, Z and SSMD values were calculated using FOR and PRO as generally stimulatory and inhibitory controls, respectively (Table 2). Assay endpoints with Z values between 0.5 and 1 are considered to be excellent assays. Each measured hormone had a positive control with a Z /C21 0.5. Furthermore, SSMD was used to demonstrate overall assay quality and directionality. FOR generally increased hormone quantities with excellent dynamic range based on SSMD values /C21 7, whereas PRO generally inhibited hormone production with excellent dynamic range based on SSMD values /C20/C0 7. Specifically, FOR stimulated androgen and estrogen hormone production while PRO inhibited the production of these hormones consistently and robustly. This study presents a high-throughput modification of an OECD-validated assay. Although high-throughput screening assays are not always amenable to traditional validation approaches, a performance-based approach was applied to help establish confidence in our identification of steroidogenesis disrupting chemicals.

It could have resulted from the fact that the percentage of the absorbed oral CPF dose in this study might have exceeded the estimated one based on the metabolites in urine or blood alone. Some amounts of the absorbed CPF could have been eliminated by other pathways, i.e., feces or breath. In turn, in other studies conducted by Mattsson et al., the recovery of CPF in urine was 70% after a single oral dose. Such differences in the absorption of CPF after oral administration may suggest that the physical form and other properties of this preparation have a significant impact on its absorbability. Therefore, for CPF, a health risk assessment was made on the basis of the acceptable daily intake (ADI) values which are 0.001 mg/kg body weight (b.w.)/day, throughout a lifetime. In contrast, the acute reference dose (ARfD) determined for these compounds is 0.005 mg/kg b.w./day. These amounts can be absorbed by the human body in no more than 24 h without risk to consumers' health. 3.3.2.

Studies on radiolabeled material indicate that chlorpyrifos and its metabolites do not selectively accumulate in any tissue. Prior exposure had no effect on the distribution of CPF and no significant dose or gender differences were observed in its metabolism. In hepatocytes, this substance is biotransformed by different pathways such as dearylation, dealkylation, glucuronidation, and GSH-dependent conjugation (Figure 2). The mechanism of CPF toxicity is related to its ability to irreversibly inhibit AChE activity in tissues, accumulating acetylcholine, an excess of which causes continuous triggering of the acetylcholine receptor, affecting the functioning of the somatic and autonomic nervous systems. However, Shenouda et al. showed that inhibition of AChE does not explain all the symptoms of CPF intoxication because exposure to CPF can affect other systems, such as the hematological, immune, and reproductive systems. Desulfuration of CPF to CPF-ox, which is dependent on the cytochrome P-450 molecule, occurs in the animal body at the initial stage of biotransformation pathways because active sulfur atoms irreversibly bind with cytochrome P-450, catalyzing the reaction. The created CPF-ox is regarded as the principal and most toxic metabolite of CPF, which is responsible for cholinesterase inhibition. Next, hydrolysis is followed by inactivation of oxon to form 3,5,6-TCP, diethyl phosphate (DEP), and DETP.

Therefore, to manipulate the expression of these biomarkers may attenuate the nephrotoxicity. However, up to date, the real function of these biomarkers in the mechanisms of CsA nephrotoxicity is poorly understood. The most promising urinary biomarkers to date are RBP, which may predict CsA nephrotoxicity in heart-transplant patients, and KIM-1, TNFα,fibronectin, and microalbuminuria, which are markers of acute CsA nephrotoxicity. Blood biomarkers of interest include indoxyl sulfate level, which may predict chronic CsA nephropathy, and Nox2, which modulates CsA-induced hypoxia. Moreover, since inhibiting miR-494 and TLR4 suppresses CsA nephrotoxicity, they may be important genetic biomarkers of this disease. The validity of these potential biomarkers should be tested in larger numbers of patients. The potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of CsA nephrotoxicity are summarized in Table 2. 3. Mechanism of oxidative stress in CsA nephrotoxicity Oxidative stress has various adverse effects on many biological systems. It is also a major effect of CsA nephrotoxicity.When rats are administered 25 mg/kg/day CsA for 21 days, their renal tissues exhibit increased levels of oxidants, xanthine oxidase activity, and inducible NO synthase (NOS) mRNA. There is also a concomitant increase in the plasma NO levels. Thus, CsA clearly induces nitrosative stress.

They control the synthesis of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). GnRH released from the hypothalamic preoptic area stimulates the anterior pituitary GnRH receptors (GnRHRs). These receptors promote the secretion of anterior pituitary gonadotropins luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) via the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling pathways. FSH triggers the growth and development of ovarian follicles in the ovaries and sperm production in the testis. FSH and LH stimulate the secretion of sex steroids and protein hormones, such as anti-Müllerian hormone and insulin-like peptide 3, as well. Anti-Müllerian hormone is essential for the inhibition of Müllerian duct development in males and the inhibition of multiple ovarian follicles' development in females. Insulin-like peptide 3 is vital for testicle descent. The production and function of steroid hormones will be discussed in the next chapter. The HPG axis regulates the levels of reproductive hormones via a positive and negative feedback loop. Higher levels of hormones from gonads inhibit the secretion of GnRH from the hypothalamus and gonadotropins from the adenohypophysis. The positive feedback loop is needed before ovulation when high levels of estradiol stimulate LH secretion from the adenohypophysis. One of the main functions of the HPG axis is the regulation of steroidogenesis. The next chapter is focused on the characterization of the steroidogenic process. The first step of the process of steroidogenesis is cholesterol synthesis."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

QWOE aids in identifying actionable AOPs, thereby providing appropriate approach for dose -response analysis to assess potential health risks associated with environmental exposure. The Bradford -Hill criteria, first proposed in 1965 for evaluating causality, have evolved to become more suitable for the evaluation of AOP.

Imbalanced data sets present one of the most complex issues in ML, particularly in classification tasks like binary classification. Typically, there are far fewer examples of toxic (active) compounds compared to the nontoxic (inactive) ones. 15 This imbalance can cause models to appear accurate overall, yet fail critically when classifying the minority class, with potentially severe implications. 16 -19 This imbalance is evident in thyroiddisrupting chemicals (TDCs), which can interfere with the synthesis of thyroid hormone (TH). Specifically, thyroid peroxidase (TPO), a crucial enzyme in TH synthesis as depicted in Figure 1A, uses hydrogen peroxide to oxidize iodide ions into iodine, which then attaches to the tyrosyl residues in thyroglobulin (TG). This reaction leads to the formation of monoiodotyrosine (MIT) and diiodotyrosine (DIT). TPO further coupling the combination of MIT and DIT to produce the essential THs triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). However, TDCs can interfere with these processes, potentially disrupting normal TH synthesis. 21 The TDCs is unevenly identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"TDCs\",\"KE\",\"Formation of MIT and DIT\"\n\"TDCs\",\"KE\",\"Coupling of MIT and DIT to produce T3/T4\"\n\"TDCs\",\"KE\",\"Disruption of normal TH synthesis\"\n\"TDCs\",\"KE\",\"Iodination of thyroglobulin tyrosyl residues\"\n\"TDCs\",\"KE\",\"Interference with thyroid hormone (TH) synthesis\"\n\"TDCs\",\"MIE\",\"Targeting thyroid peroxidase (TPO)\"\n\"TDCs\",\"KE\",\"Oxidation of iodide to iodine (TPO activity)\"\n\"TDCs\",\"AO\",\"Thyroid dysfunction\""}]}

Importantly, inhibition of MPO ameliorates adverse effects of MPO-derived oxidants and MPO ko mice are an excellent system to study the importance of MPO in systemic inflammatory reactions. Alike, amelioration of diclofenac-induced toxicity was observed with cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) null mice, and multidrug resistance-associated protein 3 plays an important role in protection against acute toxicity of diclofenac acyl glucuronide as evidenced in Mrp3 -null (KO) mice. Moreover, NSAIDs are known to produce reactive oxygen species that result in cardiovascular disease, and a structural alert/reactive metabolite concept of 200 common drugs producing a wide range of different reactive metabolites was reported.

In comparison to the rNNF results (Tab. 2), it is possible that the presence of compounds during MEA measurements contributes to higher sensitivity of the rat versus the human NNF assay. All of the aforementioned variations in assay setup and biology, either alone or in combination, can explain the discrepancies in sensitivity between the two test methods. In the future, exposure schemes of the two NNF assays should be harmonized in order to understand the true nature of species differences concerning neural network formation. This might substantially help to extrapolate from rat in vivo studies to humans using the parallelogram approach. 4.3 Use of hNNF data on deltamethrin for the development of a putative AOP In 2021, the EFSA developed an IATA case study with the goal of including all available in vivo and in vitro data, among others the data generated within the DNT IVB for DNT hazard identification for the Type II pyrethroid insecticide deltamethrin. Epidemiological studies revealed associations between childhood exposure to pyrethroids like deltamethrin and neurodevelopmental disorders, e.g., attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or autism spectrum disorder.

A droplet of approximately 400 m l cell suspension was added to 35 mm glass-bottom dishes (to obtain a cell density of 400000 cells/dish), and cells were allowed to adhere for approximately 3 h prior to the addition of extra medium to obtain a total of 2.5 ml medium/dish. After day 1 in culture, medium was replaced with comparable medium, but with 2% B27 instead of FBS. After day 4 in culture, the medium was replaced with Neurobasal-A medium supplemented with 25g/l sucrose, 450 m M glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% FBS (glutamate-free medium). All cell culture material was coated with poly -lysine (50 m g/ml). Cells were cultured in a humidified incubator at 37 C and 5% CO For cell viability experiments, PC12 cells were seeded in 48wells plates (0.3 /C2 10 cells/well) and allowed to attach overnight.

Such divergent findings might result from differences in study populations and designs. Future work is warranted to investigate potential mechanisms whereby age and health conditions (e.g., BMI) might contribute to modifying PFAS effects on inflammation. Although the evidence for the immunotoxicity of PFAS corroborates across experimental animal studies, findings are inconsistent in epidemiological studies. For instance, a review revealed strong evidence of reduced antibody response to certain vaccines in the presence of PFOA and PFOS exposure in children, indicating potential immunosuppression. However, studies conducted on adults have yielded inconsistent associations with immune outcomes. In our study, we observed that PFAS exposure was associated with alterations in immunoregulatory proteins. Specifically, we identified positive associations for several human inhibitory leukocyte Ig-like receptors (LILRBs), such as PFNA with LILRB1 in SOLAR, as well as PFHxS, PFOA, and PFAS mixtures with LILRB2, and PFNA with LILRB5 in Meta-AIR. Additionally, negative associations were found of PFOS with FCGR2A in SOLAR, and of PFOS and PFAS mixtures with FCGR2A in Meta-AIR. Previous research has reported that LILRBs contribute to immunosuppression, leading to tolerance or immune-evasion, while FCGR2A initiates cellular responses against pathogens and soluble antigens by binding to IgG. Our findings of PFAS-associated upregulation of LILRB1, 2, 5 and downregulation of FCGR2A provide potential explanations for the observed immunosuppressive effects of PFAS."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"PFAS mixtures\",\"KE\",\"↓ FCGR2A\"\n\"PFOS\",\"AO\",\"Reduced antibody response to vaccines (immunosuppression)\"\n\"PFOA\",\"AO\",\"Reduced antibody response to vaccines (immunosuppression)\"\n\"PFOS\",\"KE\",\"↓ FCGR2A\"\n\"PFNA\",\"KE\",\"↑ LILRB5 (immunoregulatory proteins)\"\n\"PFNA\",\"KE\",\"↑ LILRB1 (immunoregulatory proteins)\"\n\"PFOA\",\"KE\",\"↑ LILRB2 (immunoregulatory proteins)\"\n\"PFAS mixtures\",\"KE\",\"↑ LILRB2 (immunoregulatory proteins)\"\n\"PFHxS\",\"KE\",\"↑ LILRB2 (immunoregulatory proteins)\"\n\"PFOA\",\"KE\",\"↑ LBP (Meta-AIR)\""}]}

In the AL framework, a learner algorithm was trained on a small set of labeled examples. The learner's task in then to predict unlabled examples and identify the most informative instances to label, guided by a predefined selection criterion. This involves calculating a usefulness score for each example, highlighting those that are likely to have the most significant impact on model performance. These scores are referred to as uncertainty measures, as they quantify how uncertain the model is about its predictions. In this study, we employed the modAL framework, which provides three built-in uncertainty-based query strategies: least confidence, margin sampling, and entropy-based sampling. 47 These strategies were computed from the model's probability outputs, as shown in eqs 1 -3. The uncertainty-based query (eq 1) quantifies how uncertain the model is about the prediction it thinks is most likely. In this context, x denotes the instance to be predicted, and x represents the most probable prediction."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

To further explore this effect, in Control (n=5 mice) and Conditioned (n=6 mice) females, we measured enkephalin release dynamics during the placebo analgesia conditioning assay Post-Test with δ Light expressed in vlPAG. We observed sustained, increased enkephalin release across most Conditioned mice and a sustained decrease in enkephalin tone in Control mice ( Fig. 4l ). Comparison of δ Light fluorescence during both Early and Late phase Post-Test revealed significantly greater bulk fluorescence in the Conditioned group when compared to Controls ( Fig. 4m ).

Hart et al. showed that prenatal exposure to some phthalates could induce increased levels of total testosterone in 20 year-old men. Similarly, in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia, estradiol levels, testosterone and steroidogenic enzymes aromatase, and 5 α -reductase were increased. Other studies observed associations between postnatal exposure to phthalates in healthy and infertile men and decreased testosterone.

A remarkable amount of these pesticides spreads into the environment and this brings about immunotoxicity, carcinogenesis, and endocrine and develop mental toxicity. Authorities such EFSA, EPA, and the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, attaches importance to assessing pesticide compound mixture effects on the environment and living or ganisms. Risk assessment of pesticide mixture is a highly important issue due to environmental and human exposure. People are always exposed to pesticide combinations due to protective strategies against pests in farms in farming. However, there is still no strict rule for risk assessment of pesticide com pound mixture. Different combination risk assessment models can be seen in the literature. The most common risk assessment model is the dose addition model found in the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) guidelines.

Thus, while adverse outcome data from any whole animal model will not provide specific MOA information, the benefit of apical endpoint testing is that toxicity data is generated without prior identification of a chemical target. Developmental toxicity in vitro test batteries are useful for hazard identification, and efficient at detecting human-relevant chemical bioactivity; however, cellular bioactivity does not necessarily predict apical adverse effects, and in vitro systems are limited in their ability to model chronic effects. In contrast, SMOs with short lifespans can rapidly model adverse outcomes from acute vs. chronic exposures, suggesting the utility of supplementing in vitro data with information from a model like C. elegans with demonstrated mammalian-concordant effects for apical endpoints such as growth inhibition and altered locomotion. What is less well studied is the suitability of C. elegans to differentiate between reversible and irreversible chemical effects on development. The worm Development and Activity Test (wDAT) measures the time to C. elegans developmental milestone acquisition and stage-specific locomotor activity.

Abstract: Chlorpyrifos (CPF) was the most frequently used pesticide in food production in the European Union (EU) until 2020. Unfortunately, this compound is still being applied in other parts of the world. National monitoring of pesticides conducted in various countries indicates the presence of CPF in soil, food, and water, which may have toxic effects on consumers, farmers, and animal health. In addition, CPF may influence changes in the population of fungi, bacteria, and actinomycete in soil and can inhibit nitrogen mineralization. The mechanisms of CPF activity are based on the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. This compound also exhibits reproductive toxicity, neurotoxicity, and genotoxicity. The problem seems to be the discrepancy between the actual observations and the final conclusions drawn for the substance's approval in reports presenting the toxic impact of CPF on human health. Therefore, this influence is still a current and important issue that requires continuous monitoring despite its withdrawal from the market in the EU."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Chlorpyrifos (CPF)\",\"KE\",\"ROS production in soil\"\n\"Chlorpyrifos (CPF)\",\"KE\",\"Continuous triggering of acetylcholine receptor\""}]}

As can be seen, permethrin leads to a concentration-dependent increase of metaphases, while following mitotic stages as anaand telophases decrease. That leads to the conclusion that the arrest of cells can exclusively be attributed to the metaphase stage which is also clearly demonstrated by the strong reduction of the ratio of ana: telophases to metaphases. The arrest at metaphase stage could be attributed to the occurrence of abnormal metaphases, such as initial and full C-metaphases (Fig. 5). For permethrin up to 60% abnormal metaphases at the highest tested concentration of 12.5 m g: ml were observed. From these about 80% belonged to the type of initial C-metaphases. Such initial C-metaphases are the result of partial spindle disturbances, which might lead to aneuploidy in subsequent cell division. Aneuplody or events that lead to aneuploidy may be of considerable concern with regard to somatic and genetic consequences. An interesting point is that the increase of mitotic arrest as shown by flow cytometry and light microscopy is in good agreement with the reduction of the CFA. Therefore, it is assumed that the cytotoxic effect of pyrethroids is associated with the mitotic arresting activity. Interestingly, when plotting cytotoxic activity against the degree of impurity a rather good association could be obtained using different pyrethroids (Fig. 6)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Permethrin\",\"KE\",\"metaphase arrest\"\n\"Permethrin\",\"KE\",\"abnormal metaphases\"\n\"Permethrin\",\"AO\",\"aneuploidy potential\"\n\"Permethrin\",\"KE\",\"G2/M arrest\""}]}

Moreover, these results coincided with regulatory studies, in which similar structural changes were determined in the developing brain of rats following exposure to CPF. Moreover, a CPF dose-related decrease in plasma cholinesterase (ChE) and erythrocyte AChE activities was observed. In turn, AChE activity in the brain was decreased after the application of 1 and 5 mg/kg b.w./day in the treated groups.

To show that neural network development within the hNNF assay can be altered by a specific mechanism, DIV 7 networks were exposed to different concentrations of the PKC inhibitor Bis-I following the exposure scheme described in Figure 1. Bis-I inhibited neurite outgrowth in PC-12 cells, rat cortical neurons, and hiPSC-derived neurons. Furthermore, in vitro MEA experiments showed decreased firing and bursting rates of rat neural networks after Bis-I exposure. We observed that network activity was affected by Bis-I in a concentration-dependent manner, as illustrated by representative network parameters in Figure 4F-I. Untreated controls showed a mean firing rate of more than 10 Hz on DIV 35, whereas Bis-I interfered with the formation of a functional network starting at low concentrations of 0.12 µM, resulting in about 5 Hz (Fig. 4F). Exposure to 10 µM Bis-I resulted in a fully muted network at DIV 28 and DIV 35 regarding all four displayed network parameters. The network burst percentage was also reduced to 20% at DIV 21 and 28 by 1.11 µM Bis-I and to 0% at DIV 35 (Fig. 4H). This impairment in network bursting is also reflected in the AUNCC (Fig. 4I).

A key difference between these two types of assessments is that the wDAT is a rapid and semi-automated assay, while morphology analyses are complex and time-consuming, and not yet compatible with currently available AI solutions. Together, these data indicate that, as in mammals, C. elegans larval growth and developmental locomotor activity levels can act as screening endpoints that may reflect other conserved developmental adverse effects. Additionally, the large number of C. elegans wild-type, mutant, and transgenic strains available at low cost from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center suggest that the wDAT could be used to evaluate chemical effects on development in a wide variety of different C. elegans disease and sensitive-population models. Data from rapid alternative assays with high positive predictivity for adverse effects are useful for flagging chemicals for further study but are not sufficient on their own for determining safety in humans.

Prenatal HU exposure in rats is associated with postnatal reductions in weight, activity index, and rearing frequency, as well as delays in the development of forward locomotion. Thus, in mammals, fetal HU exposures induce both persistent growth retardation and reduced values for postnatal locomotion parameters. This study demonstrates that HU-induced developmental delays and hypoactivity were similar in the continuous and early-only exposure groups (Fig. 3A & B), indicating that, as in mammals, these adverse developmental effects of early HU exposure in C. elegans are irreversible. Ribavirin (RV) is an antiviral drug and known mammalian teratogen. Maternal oral RV exposures result in fetal malformations and reduced fetal weights in rodents. RV reversibly inhibits DNA synthesis in mouse embryos, and the teratogenic effects of RV depend on cell types that are most actively dividing at the time of exposure. In adult mice, RV-induced anemia is dose dependent, cumulative, and reversible, while RV effects on immune cells are at least partly reversible, though recovery is lost for some cell types at higher exposures.

DMSO was used as a vehicle control in the assay optimization. In the HTRF-based TNFα assay, the coefficient of variation (CV) for the wells of DMSO control was 9.09 %, with a signal-to-background ratio (S/B) of 2.62 compared to the data generated by 517.5 ng/ml LPS, resulting in a Z-factor of 0.5 (Supplementary Figure 2B-D). Similarly, in the HTRF-based IL-6 assay, the DMSO vehicle control wells of the plate exhibited a CV of 9.76 %, an S/B of 3.71 with 517.5 ng/ml LPS, and a Z-factor of 0.58 (Supplementary Figure 2E-G). These data indicate excellent assay performance for both the TNFα and IL-6 assays, validating their suitability for high-throughput screening applications within a 1536-well plate format. 3.4. Response of hiMG to other stimuli To further evaluate whether hiMG can respond to other inflammation inducers, such as IFN γ and IL-1 β, we treated hiMGs with varying concentrations of IFN γ or IL-1 β, ranging from 0.035 ng/ml to 1150 ng/ml. IFN γ concentration-dependently increased both IL-6 and TNFα secretion, with EC values of 273.2 ng/ml and 232.6 ng/ml, respectively, showing relatively lower efficacy and activity at higher concentrations in inducing cytokine secretion compared to LPS treatment (Fig. 4a)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"LPS\",\"KE\",\"Increased TNF-α secretion (hiMG)\""}]}

Some of these appear to be more specific and potentially connected in terms of mechanisms of action. Several lipid metabolism-related pathways were retrieved with the KEGG analysis. For example, pathways such as 'linoleic acid metabolism' (with a corrected p value of 8.51, via 13 proteins) and 'arachidonic acid metabolism' (with a corrected p value of 4.35, through 13 proteins), were significantly connected to BPF. Interestingly, those 2 omega-6 fatty acids have been associated with inflammation, a process which is also linked to the development of several pathologies (including cancer). Another finding was linked to endocrine-related pathways including signaling by cortisol (together with Cushing syndrome), estrogen, aldosterone, progesterone (together with 2 global steroidogenesis pathways: steroid hormone biosynthesis, ovarian steroidogenesis) and also parathyroid hormone and thyroid hormone pathways suggesting that BPF may act as an endocrine disruptor. Interestingly, changes in the expression of several adenylyl cyclases (involved in the production of cAMP and subsequently in signaling by the transcriptional factor, cAMP Responsive Element Binding protein) and of metabolizing enzymes (including cytochromes P450 and transferases) were observed suggesting that BPF could act on several processes related to these hormones (signaling and metabolism). Moreover, among the identified pathways, 4 were associated with endocrine-related cancers (prostate, endometrial, breast, thyroid) (Table 1)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"BPF\",\"MIE\",\"PPARγ binding\"\n\"BPF\",\"AO\",\"Endometrial carcinoma\""}]}

This research demonstrated PFAS-associated immunomodulation, characterized by perturbed adaptive immunity in a cross-sectional study of Czech adults, as well as impaired immune function in a Norwegian longitudinal birth cohort study. While extensive research has been focusing on the immunosuppressive effects of PFAS, limited epidemiological studies have explored the connection between PFAS and immunoenhancement because of the difficulty of diagnosing hypersensitivities. Specifically, evidence regarding the effects of PFAS exposure on infectious diseases is inconsistent, and there have been limited studies investigating hypersensitivity reactions including type I hypersensitivities (e. g., allergies and asthma) and autoimmune diseases (e.g., ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus). Recent studies on rheumatoid arthritis reported positive associations of PFAS with rheumatoid factors and Disease Activity Score 28 (DSA28). A large retrospective cohort study conducted on a population with high PFAS exposure discovered a significant increase in the incidence of ulcerative colitis linked to PFOA exposure. These findings suggest that, apart from potential immunosuppression, PFAS may also have hyperstimulation effects on the immune system, leading to an increased risk of autoimmune diseases. However, the specific mechanisms of PFAS immunotoxicity in humans remain largely undefined. In SOLAR, using IPA, we identified significant activations of immunoregulatory interactions and phagosome formation associated with PFNA, as well as a significant activation of neutrophil degranulation associated with PFOA.

A limitation of our study is that we did not evaluate the effects of AD-214 in PCLS isolated from IPF patients, arguably a more disease-relevant model. Interestingly, in a similar study to ours that compared the effect of saracatinib, a small-molecule src kinase inhibitor, the authors found only 2 of 60 genes affected were unique to IPF PCLS compared to healthy control PCLS treated with a fibrotic cocktail, suggesting the fibrotic cocktail-treated PCLS serves as reasonable surrogate for IPF. 47 Here, we were able to clearly differentiate the mechanism of action of AD-214 from pirfenidone and nintedanib, the two currently approved therapies for IPF. Both nintedanib and pirfenidone were approved based on Phase 3 studies indicating approximately 50% fewer patients who received the drugs suffered an absolute decline of 10% or more in lung function as measured by forced vital capacity; 48-50 however, despite many studies, the precise mechanism of action of these drugs remains uncertain."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"AD-214\",\"KE\",\"Not cytotoxic in BioMAP fibrosis panel\""}]}

The strategy described here is complementary to existing systems toxicological models already developed for the identification and prediction of linkages between chemicals and human health. Some of these models are hybrid methods that combine multiple methods. Others are chemical structure based, involving the physicochemical and reactivity properties of the chemicals [read-across and quantitative structure -activity relationships (QSARs)]. Both are important for the interactions with specific biological targets and pathways, and therefore allow the prediction of toxic effects. Following the OECD recommendations for the construction of robust QSARs, several models are now available such as the OPERA version 1.5 or the VEGA platform (www.vegahub.eu). Recently, a new tool that integrates both chemical similarity and biosimilarity has been developed, the Chemical In vitro-In vivo Profiling (CIIPro). This tool profiles compounds of interest utilizing biological data from public resources. It uses the data for read-across assessment with the aim of predicting complex bioactivities. Several web-based tools, such as the REACHAcross ™ tool and the ChemProt database (using virtual screening), are available. Other methods are primarily based on the delineation of the MoA and on systems biology.

In vitro data will be useful for decision-making beyond screening and prioritization if there is confidence that the concentrations at which effects are observed in vitro have relevance to blood levels that cause neurodevelopmental effects in vivo. In order to examine how the tipping points determined herein compare to dose levels associated with neurodevelopmental toxicity, compounds from Table 1 in Mundy et al. were selected as representative in vivo exposures that were associated with a DNT outcome. High-throughput toxicokinetics were then used to estimate relevant blood levels for the 6 compounds for which sufficient data existed. When compared to the tipping point concentrations, in 5 of 6 cases, the tipping points for effects on neural network function were equal to or lower than doses associated with DNT outcomes. Interestingly, diethylstilbestrol, the one compound where the tipping point did not match the levels associated with DNT outcomes in vivo, is a well-known estrogenic compound. Although acute activity in mature networks does show some responsiveness to estrogenic compounds, there is no information on whether those effects are mediated by the estrogen receptor or regarding the role of estrogen in maturation of neural networks in vitro. Thus, it could be that the in vivo effects of diethylstilbestrol are mediated via mechanisms not present in the in vitro assay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Diethylstilbestrol\",\"KE\",\"Tipping point critical concentration for altered network development\""}]}

Thus, Yang et al. showed that when rats undergo ischemia-reperfusion injury, their kidneys exhibit increased expression of the MAPKs ERK, JNK, and p38, especially in the renal tubules of the outer medulla. However, CsA preconditioning alters this expression pattern: ERK expression is further upregulated while JNK and p38 expression are decreased. Smad proteins are pivotal intracellular effectors of TGF-1: they act as transcription factors and play important roles in apoptosis. There seems to be a crosstalk between the MAPK and Smad pathways that regulates CsA-induced apoptosis in renal proximal tubular cells: Iwayama et al. showed that CsA induces the nuclear translocation of p -Smad2/3 and apoptosis, and that this required the upregulation of ERK and p38 (but not JNK). The presence of crosstalk between the MAPK and Smad pathways was shown by co-treating the cells with epidermal growth factor (EGF). EGF treatment alone activates ERK and p38 (but not JNK). When CsAtreated cells are co-treated with EGF, it inhibits the CsA-induced nuclear translocation of p -Smad2/3 and apoptosis. Since inhibiting p38 eliminated this protective effect of EGF (ERK inhibition had no effect), it appears that crosstalk between Smad and p38/ERK differentially regulates apoptosis in CsA-induced renal proximal tubular cell injury. Notably, Wang et al. showed that CsA also promotes in vitro trophoblast migration via the MAPK/ERK/NFκ B and Ca /calcineurin/NFAT pathways."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"p-Smad2/3 nuclear translocation\"\n\"Epidermal growth factor (EGF)\",\"KE\",\"Inhibits CsA-induced p-Smad2/3 nuclear translocation and apoptosis (in co-treatment)\"\n\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"Smad/MAPK crosstalk required for apoptosis\""}]}

Generally, the oxon analogues are more potent AChE inhibitors than the parent compound. In the present study, carbamate toxicity was similar under oxidised and un-oxidised conditions which is in confirmation with the fact that these pesticides do not require biotransformation to an oxon form in order to inhibit AChE enzymes. In the present study, HF-AChE inhibition exposed tofive OPs in binary mixtures with CBs was investigated under in vitro conditions. To examine the effects of oxidation on OP potency in the HF-AChE system, bromine water was used as an oxidising agent. HF-AChE inhibition for CRB and CBF was similar under oxidised and un-oxidised conditions. Individual OPs and CBs under un-oxidised conditions exhibited sensitiviy to AChE inhibition in the following order: Under oxidised conditions, CPF was observed to be the most potent pesticide and HF-AChE inhbition was in the following order: The CA model has recently been suggested as a conservative default assessment tool for aquatic mixtures (not just pesticides), irrespective of modes or mechanisms of action. Based on the fact that OPs and CBs act by a similar mechanism of inhibition of AChE, one would expect that the behaviour of a mixture would be a simple dose-additive effect.

While PDGFRA is predominantly a marker of immature OPCs, especially MBP is a myelin-associated gene increasingly expressed during oligodendrocyte maturation. Based on the marker expression and the highly branched morphology ( Figures 5A,B ), we conclude that our pre-OLs exhibit a certain degree of maturity. Similar to the neuronal differentiation described above, also the percentage of OLs within the multicellular hNPC-derived migration area increased over the differentiation time resulting in approximately 8% OLs after 5 days. It is well studied that several signaling pathways, including the Notch pathway, regulate NPC differentiation into OPCs. A study on zebrafish embryos revealed that Notch is responsible for increased production of OPCs from ventral spinal cord precursors and that the increased OPC number is not due to increased OPC proliferation. Moreover, contactin/F3-dependent Notch signaling promoted OPC differentiation from the rat oligodendroglial OLN-93 cell line and further increased the expression of myelin-associated glycoprotein. In line with that, differentiation of hNPCs in presence of the Notch inhibitor DAPT concentration-dependently decreased the percentage of O4 cells compared to the solvent control, indicating that Notch signaling is a prerequisite for hNPC differentiation into the OL lineage ( Figure 5D )."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

The PDB database was used for identifying a segment of homologous protein with a high degree of homology to it. The total score, similarity and homology of the search results were all taken into consider. Finally, 2YJA was selected as the template protein with 62.06% homology and 44% sequence coverage with zebrafish ER α. Then, an automated mode of SWISS-MODEL (https://www.sw issmodel.expasy.org) was performed for homology modeling the zebrafish ER α ( Fig. S1). Lastly, the model was evaluated with SAVES. In addition, as estrogen receptors β has a similar structure to ER α, to further ensure the selectivity of the interaction between molecules and ER α, ER β was simultaneously homology modeled based on its template protein 1L2J for subsequent docking calculations. The Molecular Docking Method (MDM) is designed on the basis of the \"lock-and-key\" principle. It predicts the mechanism of receptorligand interaction through chemometric methods, which enables accurate prediction of protein receptor ' s binding sites and its binding modes.

A. Barnes · J. W. Firman · S. J. Belfield · M. T. D. Cronin · M. Vinken · M. J. Janssen · R. Masereeuw 1 Adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) were introduced in modern toxicology to provide evidence-based representations of the events and processes involved in the progression of toxicological effects across varying levels of the biological organisation to better facilitate the safety assessment of chemicals. AOPs offer an opportunity to address knowledge gaps and help to identify novel therapeutic targets. They also aid in the selection and development of existing and new in vitro and in silico test methods for hazard identification and risk assessment of chemical compounds. However, many toxicological processes are too intricate to be captured in a single, linear AOP. As a result, AOP networks have been developed to aid in the comprehension and placement of associated events underlying the emergence of related forms of toxicity-where complex exposure scenarios and interactions may influence the ultimate adverse outcome. This study utilised established criteria to develop an AOP network that connects thirteen individual AOPs associated with nephrotoxicity (as sourced from the AOP-Wiki) to identify several key events (KEs) linked to various adverse outcomes, including kidney failure and chronic kidney disease. Analysis of the modelled AOP network and its topological features determined mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and tubular necrosis to be the most connected and central KEs."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Taken together these observations suggest that deltamethrin and carbofuran might have a similar mechanism of action. However, the deltamethrin treated worms showed no hyper-contraction. Carbofuran is an anticholinesterase. In the presence of carbofuran, acetylcholine accumulates in the synaptic cleft as a result of the inability of acetylcholinesterase to break down acetylcholine. This build-up of acetylcholine leads to over-activation of cholinergic receptors, muscle hyper-contraction, paralysis, and eventually cell death. Thus, deltamethrin and carbofuran showed the difference on body length, indicating the profile of actions of deltamethrin in C. elegans is distinct from carbofuran. While some studies have shown that the above behaviors are controlled by multiple factors. For example, the hermaphrodite-specific neurons (HSNs) control 16 egg-laying muscles via electrical connection between the vulval and the uterine muscles, although the HSNs make synapses directly only onto the vulval muscles. Foraging is a rapid, side-to-side movement of the nose generated by C. elegans as it explores its environment. Several neurons, including odorant-sensing AWA and AWC neurons, the OLQ and IL1 sensory neurons and the RMGmotor neurons, have been shown to be required for this behavior. Pharyngeal neurons MC, M2, M4, and I1 form multiple direct and indirect excitatory pathways in a robust network for control of pharyngeal pumping. Therefore, whether deltamethrin is toxic to these neurons needs further investigation."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"carbofuran\",\"KE\",\"Over-activation of cholinergic receptors\"\n\"carbofuran\",\"KE\",\"Muscle hyper-contraction and paralysis\"\n\"carbofuran\",\"KE\",\"Altered locomotion, egg laying and foraging behavior\"\n\"carbofuran\",\"MIE\",\"Anticholinesterase action and acetylcholinesterase inhibition\"\n\"carbofuran\",\"AO\",\"Cell death following cholinergic overstimulation\""}]}

Our studies highlight the relevance of dogs as a surrogate for clinical immunoallergic DILI and its effects on the immune system. Further justification of the canine model resides in the similar expression of COX1/COX2 between dogs and humans. To investigate diclofenac's mechanism of immuno-allergic hepatitis, beagle dogs were given 1 or 3 mg/kg/day for 28 days. Histopathology revealed microand macrovesicular hepatic steatosis, glycogen depletion, apoptosis, acute lobular hepatitis, granulomas and mastocytosis. Biochemical and whole genome scans revealed that diclofenac induced hypersensitivity reactions.

The proposed method comprises dualtarget bioactivity prediction models and dual-target structure generators. The dual-target bioactivity prediction models (constructed first) calculate the bioactivity scores of a compound based on its structure for both therapeutic targets (Figure 1A). For each therapeutic target, we constructed the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model using random forest regressor, which inputs the chemical structure of each compound and outputs its bioactivity (pIC value). These pIC values are averaged to obtain the objective function of the dual-target structure generator. The dual-target structure generators design the chemical structures of dual-target compounds (Figures 1B and 1C). The first generator is a fragment-based structure generator and optimizer, namely DualFASMIFRA (Figure 1B). The structures are generated by a genetic algorithm (GA) that assembles active compound fragments against the target proteins. The GA is a conservative but pragmatic structure generator. The second generator, a deep learning-based structure generator, namely sine A2a receptor (ADORA2A) and phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D). Generation of dual-target compounds using the proposed structure generators The chemical structures of compounds for dual targets, ADORA2A and PDE4D, were generated using DualFASMIFRA. These structures were optimized by combining three techniques: (1) calculation of a scoring function using the QSAR model (2) molecular generation, and (3) optimization. The affinities of the generated compounds to the therapeutic targets were estimated using a scoring function, and the overall optimization process was driven by the GA."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

İstanbul Journal of Pharmacy, 51 (2), 183-190. Background and Aims: Humans and animals have daily contact with various chemicals, including food additives, pesticides, antibiotics, other veterinary drugs, and other xenobiotics. Pesticide exposure causes many health disorders. Mixed exposure to pesticides is an important issue for human and environmental health. Methods: In this study, we have determined the cytotoxicity of chlormequat pirimiphos-methyl, glyphosate, tebuconazole, chlorpyrifos-methyl, deltamethrin, and the mixture of these six pesticides. We further investigated the role of oxidative stress, total oxidant status (TOS), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and antioxidant defense mechanism TOS, total glutathione (GSH) levels with the observed cytotoxicity. Results: In this study, the mixtures of pesticides reduced total antioxidant status (TAS) and GSH level one by one and increased the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in HUVECs, respectively. The results also showed a significant contribution of oxidative stress on cytotoxicity during pesticide mixture exposure. Conclusion: The findings are that pesticide mixture exposure might have an impact on human health risk at contaminated sites and under occupational exposure conditions.

Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) are enzymes known to metabolize a wide variety of compounds including insecticides. Their overexpression leading to enhanced insecticide detoxification could result in insecticide resistance in insects. The increased mRNA expression of two P450 genes, CYP6P7 and CYP6AA3, has been previously observed in laboratory -selected deltamethrin-resistant Anopheles minimus, a major malaria vector in Southeast Asia, suggesting their role in detoxification of pyrethroids. In this study CYP6P7 and CYP6AA3 were expressed in insect Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells via baculovirusdirected expression system. Insecticide detoxification capabilities of Sf9 cells with and without expression of CYP6P7 or CYP6AA3 were evaluated using 3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays. The results revealed that CYP6P7 or CYP6AA3-expressing cells showed significantly higher cytoprotective capability than parental Sf9 cells against cytotoxicity of pyrethroids including permethrin, cypermethrin and deltamethrin. Such cytoprotective effect was not observed for bioallethrin (pyrethroid), chlorpyrifos (organophosphate) and propoxur (carbamate). Moreover, expression of CYP6AA3, but not CYP6P7, could protect cells against λ -cyhalothrin cytotoxicity. In MTT assays upon co-incubation with piperonyl butoxide (P450 inhibitor), cytoprotective ability of CYP6P7 and CYP6AA3 against deltamethrin was diminished, implying that pyrethroid detoxification was due to activities of P450 enzymes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"chlorpyrifos\",\"KE\",\"no detoxification by CYP6AA3\"\n\"propoxur\",\"KE\",\"no detoxification by CYP6AA3\"\n\"bioallethrin\",\"KE\",\"no detoxification by CYP6AA3\"\n\"chlorpyrifos\",\"KE\",\"no detoxification by CYP6P7\"\n\"propoxur\",\"KE\",\"no detoxification by CYP6P7\"\n\"bioallethrin\",\"KE\",\"no detoxification by CYP6P7\"\n\"bioallethrin\",\"KE\",\"no metabolism by CYP6P7\"\n\"chlorpyrifos\",\"KE\",\"no metabolism by CYP6P7\"\n\"propoxur\",\"KE\",\"no metabolism by CYP6P7\""}]}

These three metabolites showed to be more potent than CBZ, with AI being the most potent, followed by 9ACA and AO. Consequently, one or more of these metabolites probably contribute to the teratogenic effects observed in zebrafish larvae after exposure to CBZ. As such, our study gained more insights on developmental toxicity and non-CYP mediated biotransformation of CBZ, LTC and their metabolites, and showed that two non-CYP phase I enzymes, B-esterases and MPOs, that were responsible for the biotransformation of these AEDs are already active in 24 hpf zebrafish embryos.

Approaches to separate chemicals may also benefit from recent improvements in the throughput of MEA systems to include 12 and 48 well MEA plates. The data for the present study were collected over a prolonged period of time and from numerous different cultures. Higher throughput MEA systems will allow for the simultaneous testing of many chemicals within the same plate and/or culture, which will reduce one source of variability for these types of measurements and allow for many more chemicals to be tested. Finally, additional data to help define compound classes need not come solely from MEA recordings, as combination of MEA data with, for example, assays from the EPA ToxCast dataset may also improve classification schemes.

The two smaller subnetworks are related to 'Oocyte-dependent fertility impairment' and encompass pAOP 8 that leads to the KE 'Impaired oocyte maturation' and pAOP 3 that leads to the KE 'Impaired oocyte quality'. Although these two subnetworks are related to the oocyte dysfunction, they do not share any MIEs and KEs. Categorization of an AOP network into subnetworks has been previously done for the AOP network for endocrine-mediated perturbations. Determination of subnetworks in this study was based on the shared KEs between the AOPs; however, harmonization of KEs, which is based on the researcher's presumption of the same/similar biological process between different AOPs, may affect determination of subnetworks. For example, the AO 'Decreased fertility, Reduced number of oocytes ovulated' was renamed to 'Reduced ovulation' and annotated as the KE to harmonize with the KE 'Reduced ovulation of oocytes' or 'Reduced ovulation' in pAOP 9 and 10.

However, a significant fraction of clinical evidence connecting A β metabolism with neuro-CVDs comes from observational human studies. These data may support a strong hypothesis, on the one hand, but may yield a risk of bias that cannot support causality, on the other hand. To that end, abundant experimental evidence as described above suggests a causal relationship between A β metabolism and CVD. 10,95-98 Genome-wide association studies linking amyloid-beta metabolism with neurocardiovascular diseases The link between CVD and AD has been reinforced by the involvement of CVD-related traits in AD in recent GWAS. 6,112 Polymorphisms associated with C-reactive protein and increased blood levels of lipid molecules (HDL, LDL, and triglycerides), which are common risk factors for CVD, are also associated with higher risk for AD. 113-116 In a GWAS of over 12 000 non-demented participants, plasma A β levels are driven by genetic variants near ApoE, BACE-1, APP, and presenilin 2 (PSEN2) genes. 117 Specifically, single-variant analysis identified Amyloid-beta metabolism Figure 2 The equilibrium of amyloid-beta aggregation, degradation, clearance, and transportation through the blood-brain barrier determines amyloid-beta accumulation in the brain, vessels, or heart.

Genetic polymorphism in ARs is common and may cause lack of or reduced functional receptor subtypes on vascular smooth muscle in some individuals. Polymorphisms in the receptors may produce differential binding, altered binding sensitivity, or receptor distribution. The impact of polymorphism on ARs is evidenced by the drug response to albuterol (salbutamol) in asthma, where it has been demonstrated that responses to receptor-blocking drugs can change. Polymorphic differences in avidity or altered kinetics among a -ARs expressed on different tissues may also explain the worsening erythema phenomenon, particularly with regard to exaggerated recurrence as drug effect wanes. If the avidity of brimonidine for the a -AR on presynaptic nerve terminals is greater than that on vascular smooth muscle, the vasoconstrictive effect on vessels may wear off as expected, but negative feedback inhibition on nerve terminals may remain for a longer period, with transiently sustained erythema. This potential mechanism also underscores the prudence of advising patients to make the first trial of medication on the weekend or a day when the patient can be comfortable even in the unlikely event that worsening erythema occurs. Brimonidine has proven strong vasoconstrictive effects on a -ARs of vessels and-to a lesser extent-on a -ARs.

There are many studies using pharmacological inhibitors, dominantnegative mutations, and genetic knockouts, along with blocking OCT2mediated uptake, that demonstrate how obstructing upstream effectors of Pt drug-induced nephrotoxicity limits kidney injury. For example, limiting the cell death signalling that occurs following Pt drug administration via p53 activation can reduce apoptosis following DNA damage. P53-deficient mice showed clear resistance to cisplatin-induced kidney injury, showing only small increases to BUN and sCr following administration. Similarly, an in vitro study using primary renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTECs) demonstrated that cisplatin-induced apoptosis is mediated by p53 and caspase 3 activation independent of either caspase 8, 9 or mitochondrial dysfunction. Pifithrinα, a pharmacological inhibitor of p53, was used to suppress cisplatin-induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, highlighting the role of early p53 phosphorylation and induction in cisplatin-induced cell death. Studies have shown that blocking the cell death pathways can alleviate Pt-drug-induced nephrotoxicity and kidney cell death."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Cisplatin\",\"KE\",\"p53 activation and apoptosis in proximal tubules\"\n\"Cisplatin\",\"KE\",\"Proximal tubule as primary renal target\"\n\"Cisplatin\",\"KE\",\"Mitochondrial structural and functional damage; decreased GSH and SOD activity\"\n\"Cisplatin\",\"KE\",\"ATR/CHK1/CHK2 phosphorylation during treatment\""}]}

Meanwhile, the danger hypothesis proposed that DAMPs can also be influenced by immune or inflammatory response. Our previous study demonstrated that diclofenac treatment induced the expression of inflammatory proteins which are released from macrophages/Kupffer cells. The subsequent inflammatory responses can reinforce the cellular damage of hepatocyte and in a vicious cycle strengthen inflammation. KE3: ER stress/unfolded protein response Genes involved in ER stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) were significantly regulated in the liver of diclofenac-treated mice. Independent studies evidenced diclofenac to trigger ER stress and UPR by PERK and ATF6 pathways as well as eIF2α phosphorylation. However, the prolonged activation of PERK/eIF2α pathway induces apoptosis by activating the pro-apoptotic factor CHOP. In addition, ER stress can alter the lipid metabolism by UPR and leads to dyslipidemia. As reported by us, diclofenac caused hepatic cholesterolosis in mice with significant alteration in the transcription of genes coding for fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism.

Overall, 11 chemicals decreased and 9 chemicals increased wMFR. Interestingly, of the 9 chemicals that increased wMFR, 4 caused decreases in #AEs that reached threshold values. The three chemicals that were expected to cause changes in activity but did not were nicotine (13.3% change in wMFR), imidacloprid (0.3% change in wMFR), and bifenthrin (5.2% change in wMFR).

Among the models evaluated, hiMG emerged as the best choice, demonstrating robust cytokine secretion and responsiveness to LPS stimulation comparable to in vivo microglial behavior. This finding indicates that hiMG can effectively replicate in vitro the inflammatory responses observed from LPS treatment in vivo, thus serving as a valuable tool for assessing chemical-induced neuroinflammation. Most microglia cell lines are derived from primary cultures obtained from the brain or the spinal cord, subsequently immortalized through viral transduction with oncogenes. The advantages of using cell lines include their ease of maintenance and abundant availability, stemming from their limitless proliferative potential. However, recent research has indicated that microglia cell lines exhibited significant genetic and functional discrepancies compared to primary microglia and ex vivo microglia. Furthermore, microglial cell lines originating from neonatal or embryonic CNS sources are unlikely to accurately represent the phenotype of adult microglia, as exemplified by HMC3, which is derived from the CHME-5 cell line. Notably, a recent investigation suggests that CHME-5 cells are actually of rat origin rather than human, raising questions about the validity of HMC3.

However, the abundance of metabolite formation differs among species. The genomic study revealed significant changes in the regulation of genes coding for immune, inflammation, apoptosis and oxidative stress responses to diclofenac treatment. In specific, the reduced expression of hepatic CYP monooxygenases and phase II enzymes is caused by inflammation and the immune response. Induced expression of acutephase proteins (SAA), alpha-macroglobulin, fibrinogen, complement factors and cytokines evidences sterile inflammation. The significant up-regulation of mainly positive acute-phase proteins evidences inflammation in response to reactive metabolites and harmed hepatocytes; notwithstanding, hepatic SOD1 protein expression is decreased after diclofenac treatment as a result of oxidative stress. KE1/KE2: mitochondrial dysfunction and  apoptotic cell death In addition, reactive metabolites of diclofenac cause cellular stress and increased the level of ROS which leads to mitochondrial damage and subsequent apoptosis in hepatocytes. Consistent with the findings observed with mice, the genomic analysis of dog liver discovered genes related to oxidative stress, mitochondrial biogenesis and membrane transport and apoptosis as significantly regulated.

Raj et al. 37 suggested that medullary congestion in the kidney was observed when mice were orally treated with a combination of cypermethrin and endosulfan. The current findings are consistent with those of Lemos et al., 38 who discovered that combining deltamethrin and B. thuringiensis subsp. Aizawai caused necrosis, degeneration of the convoluted tubules and collector ducts, proliferative glomerulonephritis, and a significant decrease in Bowman's spaces. This study concluded that repeated exposure to cypermethrin has an injurious side effect on the bodies of both male and female albino rats. The intensity and degree of damage caused by pesticides were time and dose-dependent. The observed hematological, histological, and behavioral toxicity suggested that cypermethrin exposure disrupts the body's normal functioning, resulting in serious problems. This study also suggested that cypermethrin has a toxic effect on the liver and kidney, due to which biochemical, metabolic, and excretory processes were disrupted. These effects are more adverse in female albino rats than in male rats. Chemicals. Cypermethrin (25% EC) was purchased from the pesticide store Rohtak and manufactured by Dhanuka Agritech Limited. To achieve the test concentration, adequate dilutions were made with water.

The technology is ideal for high-throughput screening and eliminates the need for more labor-intensive analytical methodologies used in the previous HT-H295R implementation. Another challenge in high-throughput implementations of the H295R screening assay that can be evaluated with the H295R-HTRF assay format is performance with basal steroid biosynthesis only (i.e., in the absence of pre-stimulation). The resulting H295R-HTRF assay adaptation was evaluated against a training set of 36 chemicals comprising reference chemicals from the OECD inter-laboratory validation study, U.S. EPA Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention (OCSPP) Guideline 890.1200 aromatase assay, and azole fungicides active in the HT-H295R assay.

In AD, α7 activation is associated with neuroprotection, amyloid clearance and cholinergic support, whereas in schizophrenia, α7 dysfunction contributes to sensory gating deficits and cognitive impairment. The high smoking prevalence in schizophrenia adds another layer of complexity, as chronic nicotine exposure may influence α7 receptor function and therapeutic response. These parallels and distinctions have driven sustained interest in α7 targeted therapies across both conditions. Among the numerous compounds tested, encenicline (EVP6124) advanced the furthest in clinical development. Early trials in schizophrenia patients yielded promising cognitive improvements, and a phase 2, placebo controlled trial in patients with mild to moderate AD also demonstrated significant enhancements in both cognitive and functional outcomes. Similarly, a phase 2 placebo controlled trial in participants with schizophrenia showed significant and clinically meaningful improvements in cognition. Despite these encouraging results, the compound faced setbacks. In 2015, two large phase 3 trials in AD were suspended due to gastrointestinal side effects, and later phase 3 trials in schizophrenia failed to meet their primary endpoints, halting further development of the compound for both conditions.

Interestingly, all three previously mentioned metabolites of CBZ (i.e., 9ACA, AI and AO) are found to be formed in man by myeloperoxidase (MPO) enzymes. MPOs are phase I enzymes present in monocytes, neutrophils, and neutrophil precursors in human bone marrow. After activation, these leukocytes interact with hydrogen peroxide and chloride to form hypochlorous acid, which oxidizes CBZ to form the following metabolites: an intermediate aldehyde, 9ACA, AI, AO, and chloroacridones (see Fig. 1). Besides the metabolization of CBZ to these metabolites in humans, one of these metabolites, AI, has already been detected in extracts of 96 hpf old zebrafish after direct exposure of the embryo to CBZ. In addition, the expression and activity of MPO enzymes have already been reported in zebrafish embryos at 18 hpf and 33 hpf, respectively. Therefore, we decided to examine whether 9ACA, AI, and AO cause developmental toxicity in zebrafish embryos and whether they are formed in this species after exposure to CBZ. The teratogenic potential of LTC has also already been examined in both mammalian and zebrafish studies. While malformations such as skeletal abnormalities, growth retardation, internal organ abnormalities and fetal mortality were reported in mammalian studies, no teratogenic effects were found when exposing zebrafish embryos to LTC. Hence, false negative results for LTC are obtained in assays using zebrafish embryos."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"CBZ\",\"AO\",\"developmental toxicity (malformed embryos/larvae)\""}]}

Among various PFAS exposure, PFNA showed significant associations with the largest number of proteins (n = 72).

Ferroptosis is initiated by lipid peroxidation and excessive iron levels. Cisplatin can increase expression of non-transferrin bound iron, while treatment with deferoxamine (an excess iron-chelating agent) was shown to improve functional and histological deterioration during cisplatin AKI. There are three apoptotic pathways: intrinsic (mitochondria), extrinsic (death receptor) and the ER stress pathways which can all be activated in PTECs. In the intrinsic pathway, cellular injury activates proapoptotic Bcl-2-associated (BAX) and BCL-2 homologous antagonist/killer (BAK1) proteins that release apoptogenic factors. Cisplatin nephrotoxicity promotes the accretion and oligomerization of BAX and BAK1 proteins to permeabilise the outer mitochondrial membrane of PTECs. Inhibition of BAX with Bcl-2 lessens mitochondrial injury and apoptosis following cisplatin treatment. Furthermore, genetic deletion of BAX increases resistance to cisplatin nephrotoxicity. Cisplatin-induced ROS production and cytochrome c release are also associated with this pathway. In the extrinsic pathway, ligand-mediated activation of death receptors on the cytoplasmic membrane, such as Fas, TNF-receptor 1 and 2 (TNFR1/2). This leads to activation of caspases 8 and 10 which activates further downstream effector caspase 3 to induce apoptosis.

The AUPRC of the margin strategy steadily increased until the third iteration, peaking at 0.813, but then declined to 0.776 when approximately 26.7% of the data was used. In contrast, the entropy strategy exhibited fluctuations, remaining at 0.783 in the third iteration and slightly increasing to 0.784 in the final iteration. These results indicate that uncertainty achieved the highest AUPRC across all strategies. Overall, the uncertainty strategy proved to be the strongest performer, consistently delivering the highest results over multiple iterations. Compared to the previous top performer, which applied AL with entropy but without stacking ensemble learning or sampling technique, this approach significantly enhanced performance (Figure 7B,D), with improvements of 86.81% in MCC, 14.76% in AUROC, and 19.68% in AUPRC. 3.6. Performance Comparison with the Traditional Brute Force Stacking Ensemble Learning Performance. To assess the reliability of our proposed technique, we conducted a traditional brute force stacking ensemble learning approach for comparison using 100% of the data set. The stack-models were trained with 12 molecular fingerprints through CNN, BiLSTM, and attention models, which led to 36 OOF PFs for the stack-model similar to the active stack-deep learning method. All the training parameters are the same with the AL method. The performance was then evaluated using three stack-models of DNNs: CNN, BiLSTM, and attention, as illustrated in Figure 8."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Therefore, we decided to explore the most significant link (BPF-thyroid cancer) using an integrative approach including text mining, literature searches, and additional databases exploration. Knowledge-Driven Analysis to Link BPF to Biological Events As a next step, to be able to further support the association of BPF with AOPs, an unsupervised analysis of the existing literature was performed using the tool AOP-helpFinder, followed by a manual targeted literature analysis, and data integration. The main idea was to decipher potential linkages, based on existing knowledge, between BPF and the previously identified endocrine-related cancers by systems biology (Table 1). First, an automatic screening of the literature was carried out using the newly developed AOP-helpFinder tool. This tool was run on the 190 publications mentioning BPF extracted from the TOXLINE database, using the developed AOP dictionary. This search led to the identification of 1 AO that is cancer, and 8 KEs (Supplementary Table 5). Allergic contact dermatitis challenge was the most common KE (KE 312), retrieved in 7 of 15 articles that mentioned a term related to AOPs, out of the 190 screened publications.

They also showed that this autophagic response to CsA treatment is driven by CsA-induced ER stress: not only did various ERstress inducers activate autophagy, the administration of salubrinal, an agent that protects cells from ER stress, inhibited the LC3II expression of CsA-treated tubular cells. Later, Yoo and Jeung showed that CsA-induced autophagy alleviates the deleterious effects of ER stress by eliminating misfolded proteins. Thus, when renal cells encounter CsA, they not only undergo ER stress and oxidative stress, they also undergo autophagy, which attenuates the ER stressinduced nephrotoxicity. On the other hand, CsA-induced autophagy itself enhances the nephrotoxicity caused by CsA treatment. Thus, autophagy plays a Janus-faced role in CsA nephrotoxicity. Thesefindings suggest thatfine regulation of autophagy could be an important therapeutic target for preventing the chronic allograft dysfunction that is caused by long-term CsA treatment. Further research that elucidates the complex functions of autophagy in CsA nephrotoxicity is warranted. The molecular mechanisms that underlie CsA nephrotoxicity involve a number of important signaling pathways. In particular, the p38, ERK, and JNK MAPK subfamilies all participate in CsA nephrotoxicity and the crosstalk between MAPK and Smad regulates CsA-induced apoptosis in renal proximal tubular cells. Moreover, NFκ B is a crucial target molecule of CsA.

Finally, from the above studies that it seems that CsA hits 100% of the biological targets directly, is that really plasuible, and what are the missing links or the molecular initiating events to say? Are these all offtarget or are they related to primary pharmacology? All these questions should be carefully considered for the future studies.

In an additional study, it has been reported that 2,4-D or other phenoxy herbicides may cause non-Hodgkin's lymphoma through lymphocyte or immune alteration. Blakley et al. suggested that alterations in lymphocyte proliferation may be a possible mechanism since lymphocytes are one of the targets of 2,4-D. On the other hand, negative findings in rat and hamster models using different techniques such as micronucleus (MN) assay, hypoxanthine-guanine-phospho-ribosyl transferase (HGPRT), and Ames test have also been reported. There is evidence for higher chromosomal damage in the somatic cells of smokers than in nonsmokers. The result of structural chromosome aberration test (SCA), micronucleus test (MN), and sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) have indicated that scores of SCE, SCA, and MN in lymphocytes of smokers are higher than nonsmokers. Conversely, some other studies have suggested that smoking has no additional effect on genetic damage. Various techniques (e.g., MN and SCA) have been used to identify substances with genotoxic activity. A more useful method for assessing the level of DNA damage is suggested to be the alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis, also known as comet assay.

The release of damage associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs) have been shown to activate pattern recognition receptors (PRR) such as the toll-like receptors (TLRs), which in turn release various chemokines and cytokines, namely TNF α that attract inflammatory cells. Some TLRs have been identified as potential drivers of cisplatin-induced pathologies and toxicities, namely TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9. Cisplatin nephrotoxicity has also been shown to be TLR4 dependent.

Activation of these PRRs activates the production of proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines, such as TNF α, IL-1 β, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-33.

Further, methylation of this region in vitro inhibited the promoter activity to z 15% of the control. Thus, methylation at CpG sites in the promoter region is important for cell-specific transcription of the BLT1 gene. The promoter region of the BLT1 gene is localized within the open reading frame (ORF) of the BLT2 gene, which encodes a low-affinity receptor for LTB4. To our knowledge, this is the first example of 'promoter in ORF' in higher eukaryotes. Key words: leukotriene B receptor • inflammation • methylation • Sp1 • THP-1 cell specific cell surface receptor, leukotriene B4 receptor (BLT). Human BLT1 cDNAs were isolated (9, 10), and its orthologues were obtained from mouse (11, 12), rat (13), and guinea pig (14, 15). Human BLT1 mRNA is expressed abundantly in leukocytes, and to a lesser degree in spleen and thymus. In mice, BLT1 mRNA is abundant in eosinophils isolated from IL-5 transgenic mice and in activated macrophages (11). Enhanced expression was also observed in activated peritoneal macrophages in rats (13). Therefore, the transcription of the BLT1 gene appears to be tightly regulated in a cell and tissue-specific manner, and is inducible by various stimuli. To elucidate the mechanism of the BLT1 expression, we analyzed the structure, promoter region, and regulation of cell-specific transcription of the human BLT1 gene."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Leukotriene B4\",\"MIE\",\"LTB4 receptor interaction (BLT/BLT1)\""}]}

The damage to DNA following Pt drug administration is known to cause a cascade of downstream effects that leads to apoptosis, necrosis, and ultimately kidney failure. It is known that damage to nDNA or mtDNA activates signal transduction pathways that cause mitochondrial dysfunction to occur. Normal mitochondrial function is necessary for cell survival, especially in cells that are rich in mitochondria due to their energy demands, such as proximal tubule cells. Their disruption impairs the MMP and decreases ATP production, resulting in excessive and unregulated ROS production. Continually elevated ROS levels disrupt cellular antioxidant systems to induce oxidative stress. Due to its proximity to sites of ROS production, mtDNA is very vulnerable to the effects of oxidative stress. Whilst evidence of the occurrence of oxidative stress during Pt drug nephrotoxicity is strong, the exact mechanisms behind its contribution remain unclear. Extensive disruption of proximal tubule cellular function has been shown to induce apoptotic and/or necrotic cell death. The mechanisms that contribute to the induction of the inflammatory response become exacerbated following necrotic cell death. Inflammation plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of Pt drug nephrotoxicity, with a vast array of cytokines and chemokines implicated in its progression. DAMPs released from the rupture of dying tubule cells activate DAMP receptors that help trigger a robust inflammatory response."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Analysis conducted on the derived HFRT-AOP network is shown in Fig. 2 and Supplementary Material 1, Table S6.

Twelve nodes that mostly belong to MIEs showed the degree level of 1. This level of degree is important in the identification of points of convergence and divergence. The point of convergence represents an integrative point that can be affected by several upstream elements. In contrast, a point of divergence is a point of branching off from a common KE to a wider range of possible outcomes.

For example, when mice are chronically treated with CsA, their kidneys not only exhibited oxidative renal injury, they also displayed increased expression of LC3II and beclin-1. The expression of active caspase-3 was also increased and colocalized with LC3II in the injured areas of the CsA-treated kidneys. The kidneys also exhibited p62 accumulation, which indicates poor autophagic clearance. Significantly, co-treatment with antioxidants decreased autophagosome formation and improved the clearance of toxic protein aggregates. This suggests that chronic CsA nephrotoxicity involves excessive autophagosome production and poor autophagic clearance. Thus, the regulation of autophagy may be an important therapeutic target for preventing the chronic allograft dysfunction that is caused by long-term CsA treatment in renal-transplant recipients. Since activation of the signaling pathways MAPK, PI3K, and STAT3 contribute to the CsA nephrotoxicity. Moreover, the pathways p38/MAPK, ERK/MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and STAT3 have close relationship with autophagy and nephrotoxicity. It is very possible that CsAfirst activates these pathways and subsequently induces the autophagy and promotes the nephrotoxicity. Nevertheless, the exact mechanisms in this context are not yet clear. Notably, a subsequent study by Lim et al. showed that when CsA-treated mice were concurrently treated with Korean red ginseng (KRG), renal function improved andfibrosis was reduced. Moreover, the expression of LC3II, beclin-1, and the number of autophagic vacuoles decreased significantly and autophagic clearance improved, as shown by less accumulation of p62 and ubiquitin.

Rosacea-related erythema can have short or long durations, and may take many forms, including persistent underlying redness, transient erythema (flushing) that is triggered by stimuli, or redness associated with individual inflammatory lesions or telangiectasias. Relatively little is understood about the mechanisms that cause of redness, but both vascular and inflammatory events are involved. Neurogenic inflammation may have a role; in this case, dysregulated neurovascular communication may lead to sustained vasodilation induced by various trigger factors (e.g., spicy food, exercise, heat, etc.) and thereby prolong flushing ( ± stinging/burning). Neurologic factors also can influence vascular responses, and both sensory and autonomic nerves interact with immune cells in the process of flushing. Non-transient erythema of rosacea could represent a form of neurogenic inflammation, with immune mediators released by endothelial cells, keratinocytes, and immune cells resulting in chronic inflammation. Or, pathogens may activate innate immune receptors, such as toll-like receptor-2 (TLR-2) and upregulate antimicrobial peptides, such as cathelicidin LL37. LL37 can induce inflammation and vascular responses, and stimulate the release of cytokines and other mediators that secondarily activate neurovascular changes. Topical brimonidine gel 0.33% is approved to treat rosacea-associated redness.

The effects reported by Defranchi and co-workers may not have been mediated by nAChR, which was not tested in that study. Alternatively, it is possible that the culture model used here is not responsive to nicotinic modulation, and the lack of response to nicotine in the present study reflects this. Imidacloprid has a lower affinity for some subtypes of nAChR than nicotine and can function under some conditions as a partial agonist. Given the lack of response to nicotine in the present study, it is not surprising that imidacloprid did not alter network activity. Compared to the two nicotinic agonists, it is interesting that two cholinesterase inhibiting insecticides, chlorpyrifos oxon and carbaryl, caused clear effects in the present study.

Exposure to 3 µM BIC increased general electrical activity, especially synchronous bursting (Fig. 3A, pink boxes), whereas 30 µM CNQX led to a loss of organized activity, as illustrated by representative 100-s spike raster plots (Fig. 3A,B). For additional quality control of the test method, acute treatments with the two described modulators were included in every assay run.

Currently, it is unclear that whether the CsA-induced Ca 2+ signaling is involved in the mechanism of inhibition of calcineurin. The NO pathway prevents CsA-associated vasoconstriction and thereby helps attenuate CsA-induced nephrotoxicity. However, whether CsA increases or decreases NO expression is not yet clear. Some studies show that CsA significantly decreases NO levels and that this loss of NO protection reduces the vascular tone and makes the kidney more susceptible to CsA nephrotoxicity. However, other studies show that NO synthesis is enhanced during CsA nephrotoxicity and that this counterbalances the predominantly preglomerular vasoconstriction. We suspect that overall, CsA in the kidney inhibits NO synthesis and induces renal endothelium-dependent apoptosis and nephrotoxicity. However, studies on the NO levels in CsA nephrotoxicity and its exact functions in this context are needed. Given that chronic CsA nephropathy increases the rate of late allograft loss and chronic renal failure, a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie chronic CsA-induced renal injury is essential to improve the long-term outcomes of CsA-treated patients. Future questions that should be addressed include the ideal dosing schedule of additional immunosuppressive agents, the distinction between nephrotoxicity and rejection, and the precise mode of ADME studies.

By introducing the mutation at this Sp1 binding site in p( 2 123/ 1 91), the promoter activity was decreased to z 25% of the wild-type. These results clearly indicate that Sp1 is important for the basal transcription of the human BLT1 gene. In the promoter of several myeloid-specific genes such as CD11b (35), CD18 (36), and hematopoietic cell kinase genes (37), Sp1 was reported to act as a major activator. Although Sp1 is a ubiquitous transcription factor, it is preferentially expressed in hematopoietic cells (38). It is still undetermined how Sp1 mediates the tissuespecific transcription. In our study, significant basal promoter activity was observed in HeLa cells, which do not express BLT1 intrinsically. EMSA showed that Sp1 binds to the BLT1 promoter using nuclear extracts from HeLa cells, and mutagenesis in this Sp1 binding site abolished the promoter activity in HeLa cells, as observed in the case of THP-1 cells. Therefore, Sp1 binding to the BLT1 promoter clearly can not explain the tissue and cell-specific expression of BLT1. The promoter analysis of l -histidine decarboxylase (39) and leukosialin (CD43 [reference 40]) genes revealed that Sp1 is a major activator for their transcription.

In human CKD, ATR expression inversely correlates with DNA damage. Downstream of ATR, both CHK1 and CHK2 are phosphorylated during cisplatin treatment in an ATR-dependent manner. Inhibiting either ATR or CHK2 reduces cisplatin induced P53 activation and apoptosis in cultured PTECs. Carboplatin preferably stimulates CHK2 in tubular cells and strongly triggers phosphorylation in both CHK1 and CHK2 in glomerular cells. Cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin have all been shown to stimulate ATR-CHK2 signalling. To allay AKI and consequent fibrosis, ATR-mediated DDR stimulates the adaptive DNA repair of injured PTECs. Inhibition of ATR was shown to cause greater PTEC injury in organoids and cultured PTECs. Inactivation of ATM via caspase-mediated proteolysis also facilitates DNA damage-induced progression of cell apoptosis. ATM deficiency sensitizes cells to Pt-induced apoptosis, signifying a cytoprotective role of ATM. Therefore, caspase-dependent proteolysis of ATM inactivates regulatory molecules to facilitate the progression of apoptosis. Most cisplatin-induced apoptosis is mediated by p53 accumulation in the proximal tubules. Pharmacological inhibitors, dominant-negative mutations, and p53 knockouts have all been utilised to reduce or nullify cisplatin-induced cell apoptosis.

The core idea is that ML algorithms can achieve greater performance with fewer labeled data points by choosing the data they learn from. An active learner selects unlabeled examples for which it requests to label, typically from an oracle such as human expert. This approach is especially useful in modern ML tasks where unlabeled data is plentiful, but acquiring labels can be challenging, time-consuming, and costly. 9 AL's iterative nature allows researchers to efficiently explore chemical space, even with limited data, and prioritize biochemical screenings. 10 A key component of AL is the selection strategy, which identifies the most valuable unlabeled data points to improve the model. This selection can be guided by model-based strategies that use existing labeled data to choose new points that maximize model performance. AL strategies balance exploration and exploitation, focusing on discovering novel molecular activities while enhancing known effects. Once tested, selected molecules are added to the training set, further refining the model. Some AL approaches combine multiple selection strategies or use clustering techniques to enhance exploration, ensuring a diverse range of data is considered. This iterative, refined process draws from principles of selection strategy, enabling AL systems to improve continuously by focusing on the most valuable data points."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Results: Results after adjusting for multiple comparisons showed 13 significant PFAS-associated proteins in SOLAR and six in Meta-AIR, sharing similar functions in inflammation, immunity, and oxidative stress. In SOLAR, PFNA demonstrated significant positive associations with the largest number of proteins, including ACP5, CLEC1A, HMOX1, LRP11, MCAM, SPARCL1, and SSC5D. After considering the mixture effect of PFAS, only SSC5D remained significant. In Meta-AIR, PFAS mixtures showed positive associations with GDF15 and IL6. Exploratory analysis showed similar findings. Specifically, pathway analysis in SOLAR showed PFOAand PFNA-associated activation of immune-related pathways, and PFNA-associated activation of inflammatory response. In Meta-AIR, PFHxS-associated activation of dendric cell maturation was found. Moreover, PFAS was associated with common protein clusters of immunoregulatory interactions and JAK-STAT signaling in both cohorts.

In a study conducted on cotton field workers who were exposed to several persistent pesticides; total frequency of chromosomal aberrations in smokers was more than those determined in the unexposed population ( n 5 20). It was reported that these subjects were exposed to dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane, benzene hexa chloride, endosulfan, malathion, methyl parathion, monocrotophos, quinolphos, dimethoate, phosphomidon, cypermethrin, and fenvelrate in the cotton fields. However, others have suggested that smoking has no additional effect on genetic damage. In our study, we did not determine additional genotoxic effects of the pesticides tested (except 2,4-D) on human lymphocytes collected from smoking subjects. This discrepancy may be attributed to long exposure period of some of these pesticides in smoker workers compared to very short incubation period in vitro in our study."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"2,4-D\",\"KE\",\"Increased DNA damage in smokers at 10 µM\"\n\"cypermethrin\",\"KE\",\"Increased DNA damage in human lymphocytes at high concentration\"\n\"cypermethrin\",\"KE\",\"Micronucleus formation/chromosomal aberrations reported\""}]}

The 2 assays provided similar results, with LDH release being slightly more sensitive, as it detected effects of 7 compounds where Alamar blue reduction did not reach the threshold for determining an EC value, and 5 compounds where LDH EC values were at least 3-fold lower than the Alamar blue values. Conversely, by the same measures, Alamar blue was more sensitive in only 2 cases (Bis 1 and thiouracil). Comparing cell viability EC values to the EC values for network effects allows for an examination of whether the effects observed on network function were specific or concomitant with cell death or loss of metabolic activity. This comparison was made for each network parameter and by using the minimum network parameter EC for each compound (Figure 4A). These results suggest that for all compounds that exhibited cytotoxicity, as defined by a 50% reduction in signal, there was at least 1 network effect observed at a lower concentration. However, applying a cutoff of 3-fold or greater EC for cell viability to EC for network parameter ratio (Figure 4A), some compounds caused network effects at markedly lower concentrations than that required for decreased viability, including domoic acid, haloperidol, and deltamethrin."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Domoic acid\",\"KE\",\"Selective network disruption at lower concentrations than viability effects\"\n\"Haloperidol\",\"KE\",\"Selective network disruption at lower concentrations than viability effects\"\n\"Deltamethrin\",\"KE\",\"Selective network disruption at lower concentrations than viability effects\""}]}

Therefore, the utilization of indigenous microorganisms for CPF removal from environmental matrices has become the focus of researchers because of its efficient, economical, and eco-friendly nature. The negative effects caused by CPF in the environment are mainly confined to changes in the soil microflora population, which may result in, among others, inhibition of nitrogen fixation, changes in the activity of soil enzymes such as phosphatase and beta-glucosidase, and changes in the migration of antibiotic resistance genes. On the other hand, in the aquatic environment, genotoxic and neurotoxic effects have been observed, and an increased level of oxidative stress in freshwater organisms has also been detected. Therefore, it seems crucial and justified to introduce modern bioremediation methods that include selected microorganisms, including endophytes, and use nano-materials that support processes that reduce the risk of CPF in the environment. CPF has been detected in biota at various trophic levels due to the fact that it can be transmitted by air currents over long distances (transboundary transport). This can lead to adverse effects on human health and cause serious environmental effects, justifying the monitoring of CPF in various environmental compartments. Regarding human health, the available epidemiological studies present irrefutable evidence of the harmful effects of CPF on human health."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"CPF\",\"KE\",\"Oxidative stress in tissues/cells\"\n\"CPF\",\"AO\",\"Soil microflora altered / nitrogen fixation inhibited\""}]}

The ability to make novel observations or to confirm suspected effects using this tool, combined with integrative systems biology, is clearly illustrated by our observations on putative links between BPS and obesity.

The present study deals with the genotoxicity of five synthetic pyrethroid insecticides currently used in modern agriculture in great extent: cypermethrin (Cyp), deltamethrin (Del), fenpropathrin (Fep), fenvalerate (Fev), and permethrin (Per). These chemicals are carboxylic acid esters with three chirial centres located at carbons 1 and 3 of the cyclopropane ring and at the a-carbon of the alcohol moiety. All of them, except permethrin, have a cyano group which has been related to mammalian toxicity (see Fig. 1). The genetic end-point chosen for this study was the micronucleus assay in cultured human iymphocytes. Micronuclei (MN) are acentric chromosome fragments or whole chromosomes that are left behind during mitotic cellular division and appear in the cytoplasm of interphase cells as small additional nuclei."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Permethrin\",\"KE\",\"mostly negative MN results\"\n\"Cypermethrin\",\"KE\",\"slight micronucleus increase\"\n\"Fenpropathrin\",\"KE\",\"slight micronucleus increase\"\n\"Deltamethrin\",\"KE\",\"slight micronucleus increase\"\n\"Fenvalerate\",\"KE\",\"possible suggestion of an effect\"\n\"Fenpropathrin\",\"KE\",\"strong cytotoxicity\""}]}

A final issue to consider is the quantitative errors of prediction of Hershberger LOEL values using the IVIVE approach. There are 7 chemicals (the true positives) in the Hershberger reference set with Hershberger LOEL values (taken as the lowest of the LOELs across all studies for a given chemical). The root mean square error (RMSE) between the Hershberger LOEL and the IVIVE LOEL is 0.85 log (mg/kg/day). To calculate the IVIVE LOEL, we converted the antagonist AUC to a concentration using the calibration curve (Supplemental Fig. S1) and then divided by C or C. Values are given in Supplemental Table S7, column R. We compared this with the variation among Hershberger studies in the database of Browne et al. The corresponding RMSE comparing one Hershberger LOEL to another for chemicals with replicate studies is 0.75 log (mg/kg/day), close to the value for Hershberger-to-IVIVE RMSE. A recent study [Pham et al. submitted] examining variability in vivo LOEL values across multiple study types reported RMSE values in the range of 0.47-0.63 log (mg/kg/day), which indicates that the Hershberger variability is at the high end of this spectrum."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

The vlPAG receives direct spinal nociceptive inputs and consequently this innervation serves to increase MOR cell activity directly while either directly or indirectly blunting enkephalin tone. This suppression of enkephalin signal may serve to permit transmission of nociceptive signals to forebrain affective-motivational centers via projections to medial thalamic nuclei, for example, as nociception is protective. Progression of nociception into protracted or chronic pain states boosts enkephalin release in vlPAG in a manner that may facilitate pain relief and recovery. This tonic pain-related increase in enkephalin can be mimicked through modulation of expectancies surrounding pain or aversive experience and direct optogenetic activation of vlPAG Penk + neurons. Operationally, we hypothesize that increased enkephalin release in vlPAG is antinociceptive while suppressed enkephalin release is pronociceptive. Human and our new rodent evidence now converge to demonstrate that upregulation of endogenous opioid peptide signaling and suppression of vlPAG MOR neuron activity are key mechanisms of analgesia. These insights underscore the dynamic regulation of vlPAG MOR neurons by endogenous opioids in distinct pain states and in response to multiple cognitive expectancies, such as fear and placebo. By specifically enhancing enkephalin signaling within the vlPAG, it may be possible to achieve effective pain relief without the harmful side effects associated with prescribed opioid analgesics."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Whereas a large number of studies have been devoted to decipher BPA effects, much less is known about its substituents. To support decision making on BPF's safety, we have developed a new computational approach to rapidly explore the available data on its toxicological effects, combining text mining and integrative systems biology, and aiming at connecting BPF to adverse outcome pathways (AOPs). We first extracted from different databases BPF-protein associations that were expanded to protein complexes using protein-protein interaction datasets. Over-representation analysis of the protein complexes allowed to identify the most relevant biological pathways putatively targeted by BPF. Then, automatic screening of scientific abstracts from literature using the text mining tool, AOP-helpFinder, combined with data integration from various sources (AOP-wiki, CompTox, etc.) and manual curation allowed us to link BPF to AOP events. Finally, we combined all the information gathered through those analyses and built a comprehensive complex framework linking BPF to an AOP network including, as adverse outcomes, various types of cancers such as breast and thyroid malignancies."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Bisphenol F (BPF)\",\"AO\",\"Cancer\""}]}

Furthermore, Toxics based on AIC values, the fitted performance of GUTS-SD (249.03) in fish is better than that of GUTS-IT (271.46) (Figure 2b). At the acute level, the GUTS-SD model outperforms the GUTS-IT model in predicting the survival rate observed in O. mossambicus following exposure to deltamethrin. The greater predictive value of the GUTS-SD model compared to the GITS-IT strongly indicates that the response of exposed fish to deltamethrin exposure will elicit a shared threshold above which the exposed population will experience random deaths (stochastic death). Toxicodynamic inferences from the stochastic death model inherently indicate that since the survival threshold is shared by the population, toxicity responses will more likely elicit systematically faster compensation and damage repair mechanisms than if individual tolerance was applicable. This faster recovery potential predicted by the stochastic model has been attributed to the narrow tolerance distribution in the test population.

All AOPs, regardless of their developmental stage, were nevertheless included in the characterisation and analysis of the network. The present study utilised an established method to construct and examine an AOP network for nephrotoxicity. Although the network may not encompass all mechanisms of nephrotoxicity, this exercise nevertheless provided valuable direction for prioritising KEs for purposes of testing. Except in highly specific cases, AOP networks can serve as predictive functional units for most chemically induced AOs. Thus, it is reasonable to focus on KEs shared across multiple AOPs relevant to nephrotoxicity. Analysis of the network identified tubular necrosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress as the most connected and central KEs. Therefore, these should be considered during the selection, development, and optimisation of in vitro or in silico assays for predicting chemical-induced nephrotoxicity. However, it is important to note that consideration should also be given to the application of all appropriate in vitro assays, in order to combat potential redundancies when establishing future models. Cytotoxicity was the most reported KE in the network, based on the prerequisites defined previously. However, due to the assumed commonality of this KE across AOPs describing various biological systems, it was not judged sufficiently unique to warrant exclusive consideration for in vitro assay development relating to nephrotoxicity. Instead, it is recommended that testing of this KE be combined or substantiated with additional, more diseasespecific endpoints."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Similarly, Pistollato et al. utilized the neurodevelopmental toxicity AOPs from AOP-Wiki and the shared KEs as in vitro cell-based experimental endpoints to assess neurodevelopmental toxicity. They found that mixed exposure to lead, BPA, and chlorpyrifos resulted in severe neurodevelopmental toxicity through synergistic action mode. By using an AOP-based approach, we here predicted that the joint action mode of co-exposure to DEHP and BPA resulting in ASD is likely to be an additive or synergistic effect. Despite these two newly constructed AOPs have not been verified by the OECD, our findings could provide novel insights for studying DEHP and BPA mixture exposure on ASD-related phenotypes ( e.g., synaptic formation and plasticity, dendritic spine density) by in vitro and in vivo approaches. In this study, we have identified two preliminary AOPs linking DEHP or BPA with ASD with a moderate level of confidence. Specifically, the AOP of DEHP exposure related ASD suggests a possible mechanism involving the reduction of NMDAR expression, while BPA exposure related ASD seems to be likely mediated by estrogen antagonism. We propose that co-exposure to BPA and DEHP may exacerbate the risk of ASD possibly via an additive or synergistic joint action mode, which requires further experimental validations."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"DEHP\",\"KE\",\"Decreased dendritic spine and synaptic density\"\n\"DEHP\",\"KE\",\"Decreased dendritic spine density in hippocampus\"\n\"BPA\",\"KE\",\"Altered dendritic spine density in hippocampus\""}]}

However, dietary epicatechin does not get absorbed into plasma in significant amounts due to extensivefirst pass metabolism, which is why this study used i.p. injection. This would require a human to inject the compound each day, which would raise compliance issues. Olive leaf extract also has some ameliorating potential on CsA nephrotoxicity in rats. Apocynin protects the kidney function from toxic effects induced by CsA via the inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity. Very recently, Lai et al. showed that schisandrin B alleviated of CsA nephrotoxicity by reducing ROS levels through suppressing activities of oxidative stress, apoptosis, and autophagy. Spirulina is a promising renoprotective natural agent against renal injury induced by CsA. Spirulina ameliorates CsA-mediated kidney oxidative stress through decreasing glutathione, lipid peroxidation, and nitrite kidney content while increasing SOD activity.

MIE and AO are linked with a series of intermediate steps known as the key events (KEs). In other words, an AOP is a simplified depiction of complex toxicological processes in a linear and modular format starting with an MIE and ending with an AO. The AOP concept can be used for broad purposes including the establishment of structure-activity relationships, the development of novel in vitro toxicity screening tests, and the elaboration of prioritization strategies. Moreover, it can be useful in identifying data gaps and uncertainties in the pathway linking exposure to the molecular and cellular response and then to the potential AO. Pathways are often interconnected and perturbations in one pathway will lead to perturbations of the connected branches, thus forming a more complex and comprehensive network-an AOP network. An AOP network is, therefore, defined as an assembly of two or more AOPs that share one or more KEs, including specialized KEs such as MIEs and AOs. The AOP network more faithfully depicts the path to the disease processes; hence, it is more applicable to real-life scenarios."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"DEHP\",\"AO\",\"Adverse IVF outcomes (association)\""}]}

Yet the EGF effects on hiNPC migration were weaker than in primary hNPCs (122% compared to 130% (0.5 ng/ml EGF) and 127% compared to 143% (1 ng/ml EGF)). This might be due to the developmental timing since the density of EGFR increases processivity through brain development. Hence, the reduced responsiveness of hiNPCs to EGFR signaling could indicate that hiNPCs represent an earlier developmental time point compared to fetal hNPCs. However, since the observed differences were minor, additional studies are needed to thoroughly compare EGF function on hNPC and hiNPC migration. Further important regulators of neurodevelopmental migratory processes are SRC-kinases. Treatment of differentiating hiNPCs with the SRC-kinase inhibitor PP2 for 72 h reduced the migration distance to 51% of the respective solvent control without inducing any signs of cytotoxicity ( Figure 8D ). This is comparable to the hNPC response to PP2 exposure ( Figure 3D ). Last, we studied the effects of the RhoA GTPase activator narciclasine on hiNPC migration. RhoA activation reduced hiNPC migration in a concentration-dependent manner ( Figure 8E ).

Thus, AD-214 is a novel antifibrotic with a mechanism of action that does not overlap with the currently approved drugs for IPF. Notably, pirfenidone has been shown to induce an increase in CXCR4 levels, 9 therefore AD-214 may offer added therapeutic benefit when used in combination. Pharmacological characterization of AD-214 suggests that the anti-fibrotic effects could be contributed by its modulation/blockade of CXCR4-mediated β-arrestin (IC50: 7 nM)/cAMP (IC50: 7.3 nM) signaling more so than Ca2+ signaling where the IC50 is more modest (56 nM). While we cannot rule out this possibility, epitope mapping studies for AD-114 and two i-bodies with similar affinities for CXCR4 demonstrate distinct epitopes are engaged, leading to different pharmacological outcomes for each i-body, 18 and in follow-up studies only AD-114 and AD214 have demonstrated significant anti-fibrotic activity. 13,18, 33 Collectively, these data suggest that the cumulative effect of β-arrestin, cAMP, and Ca2+ signaling pathways downstream of CXCR4 contributes to the overall potency and efficacy of AD-214; however, it would be interesting for future studies to explore the relative contribution of these pathways to the anti-fibrotic effects of AD-214, particularly given the important role of Ca2+ signaling in lung fibrosis identified by others. 53,54 Lastly, we developed a method to link AD-214 engagement with CXCR4, RO, and efficacy to estimate doses of AD-214 that could be efficacious in future Phase 2 clinical trials."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Thus, CsAinduced autophagy may protect kidney cells from nephrotoxicant-induced renal injury by the same mechanisms. The protective role of autophagy in CsA treatment is supported by several other in vitro models. First, Ciechomska et al. showed that when malignant glioma cells are treated with CsA, they undergo both apoptosis and autophagy. The apoptosis is promoted by ER stress while the autophagy is induced by inhibition of the mTOR/p70S6K1 pathway. Notably, when the autophagy effectors ULK1, Atg5, or Atg7 were silenced, the levels of active caspase-3 and -7 and PARP degradation rose; the cells also exhibited greater CsA-induced death. Similarly, when rat pituitary GH3 cells were treated with CsA, while the majority underwent apoptosis, some underwent autophagy. This suggests that autophagy attenuates apoptosis, thereby protecting cells from CsA-induced death. Notably, CsA-induced autophagy may also prevent other diseases. For example, Chandler et al. showed that CsA treatment can prevent the opacification of the posterior capsule of the lens by inducing autophagy. Interestingly, the very recent study by Fakharnia et al. showed that CsA can also decrease autophagy (and apoptosis): when rats receive a global cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury, their cerebral tissues exhibit opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and undergo both apoptosis and autophagy. The effect of the injury on the mitochondria is mediated by cyclophilin D."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"p62 accumulation indicates poor autophagic clearance\""}]}

Therefore molecular docking still occupies an irreplaceable position in the early stages of drug design, and discussing the outcomes of molecular docking is still an important way to improve the efficiency of this process.

Significant promoter activity was observed in both cell lines transfected with the constructs containing the region between 2 1091 and 2 76 relative to the adenosine residue of the initiator sequence (Fig. 3).

These results suggest that the region from 2 76 to 2 33 is crucial for the basal transcription of the BLT1 gene. Surprisingly, another ORF homologous to BLT1 overlapped the promoter region.

By implementing AL, we can enhance data efficiency and reduce the burden of extensive labeling, making it a promising approach for in silico toxicology. 14 In standard supervised learning, such as binary classification, the aim is to create models with high predictive performance from labeled training data. AL seeks to make the most effective use of labeled data by allowing the learning algorithm to select the most informative samples through various strategies. In this context, utility typically refers to uncertainty reduction. One popular approach, uncertainty strategies, quantifies utility based on predictive uncertainty, selecting instances using probabilistic measures, such as entropy and margin. 62 In our study, we utilized the uncertainty, margin, and entropy strategies to determine the most effective approach for predicting TPO toxicity. Before these strategies, to assess the robustness of our approach, we tested three randomly selected 10% subsets of the training data across multiple model architectures. Among these, the subset number 1 trained with the BiLSTM consistently showed the most stable and strong performance. Therefore, subset 1 was selected as the initial data for subsequent experiments, instead of the other two subsets. Building on this, we trained traditional ML approaches for performance comparison.

These values indicate that, on average, test compounds share about half of their structural features with those in the training set, highlighting a moderate level of chemical overlap. The median suggests that some test molecules closely resemble training examples, while others showcase more novel chemical structures. This diversity ensures a robust validation approach by integrating both familiar and distinct chemical structures for performance evaluation. The t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) visualization revealed meaningful molecular groupings based on substructure counts for the training and test sets, respectively (Figure 3E,F). This fingerprint was chosen for its ability to effectively capture structural features, as supported by a previous study demonstrating promising performance on the TPO data set. 5 The plot showed some overlap between active and inactive compounds, reflecting a complex classification space. Both training and test sets span similar chemical space, with clusters enriched in either active or inactive compounds, which may aid model differentiation. Overall, this suggests well-represented chemical diversity and confirms that substructure counts capture key molecular similarities. 3.2. Initial Subsets Performance.

Microelectrode array (MEA) approaches have been proposed as a tool for detecting functional changes in electrically excitable cells, including neurons, exposed to drugs, chemicals or particles. However, conventional single well-MEA systems lack the throughput necessary for screening large numbers of uncharacterized compounds. Recently, multi-well MEA (mwMEA) formats have become available to address the need for increased throughput. The current experiments examined the effects of a training set of 30 chemicals on spontaneous activity in networks of cortical neurons grown on mwMEA plates. Each plate contained 12 wells with 64 microelectrodes/well, for a total of 768 channels. Of the 30 chemicals evaluated, 23 were known to alter neuronal function in vivo (''positives''), including 6 GABAergic and 3 glutamatergic antagonists/agonists, 4 pyrethroids, 3 metals, 2 cholinesterase inhibitors, 2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists, valproic acid, verapamil, and fluoxetine. Seven compounds expected to have no effect on neuronal function were tested as ''negatives'' (glyphosate, acetaminophen, salicylic acid, paraquat, saccharin, D-sorbitol and amoxicillin)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Fluoxetine\",\"MIE\",\"SSRI\""}]}

The concept of adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) has become instrumental for risk assessment of drug class effects. We report AOPs specific for immune-mediated and drug hypersensitivity/allergic hepatitis by considering genomic, histo and clinical pathology data of mice and dogs treated with diclofenac. The findings are relevant for other NSAIDs and drugs undergoing iminoquinone and quinone reactive metabolite formation. We define reactive metabolites catalyzed by CYP monooxygenase and myeloperoxidases of neutrophils and Kupffer cells as well as acyl glucuronides produced by uridine diphosphoglucuronosyl transferase as molecular initiating events (MIE). The reactive metabolites bind to proteins and act as neo-antigen and involve antigen-presenting cells to elicit B and T-cell responses. Given the diverse immune systems between mice and dogs, six different key events (KEs) at the cellular and up to four KEs at the organ level are defined with mechanistic plausibility for the onset and progression of liver inflammation. With mice, cellular stress response, interferon gamma, adipocytokine and chemokine signaling provided a rationale for the AOP of immune-mediated hepatitis. With dogs, an erroneous programming of the innate and adaptive immune response resulted in mast cell activation; their infiltration into liver parenchyma and the shift to M2-polarized Kupffer cells signify allergic hepatitis and the occurrence of granulomas of the liver."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Diclofenac\",\"AO\",\"Immune-mediated hepatitis\"\n\"Diclofenac\",\"KE\",\"Mast cell activation\"\n\"Diclofenac\",\"AO\",\"Hypersensitivity/allergic hepatitis\"\n\"Diclofenac\",\"KE\",\"Granulomas in liver\"\n\"Diclofenac\",\"KE\",\"Neoantigen-driven B- and T-cell responses\"\n\"Diclofenac\",\"MIE\",\"Reactive metabolite formation (quinoneimine/iminoquinone)\"\n\"Diclofenac\",\"KE\",\"Mastocytosis / mast cell infiltration\""}]}

Also, the investigators of the TC 5619 phase 2 clinical trial suggested that the chosen dosing strategy and treatment duration may have influenced the primary outcome.

The detrimental effects of PFAS exposure on human health have been extensively documented in numerous systematic reviews and meta-analyses, particularly on cardiometabolic health, such as diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. According to a study conducted among 1.3 million adults with overweight or obesity in the US in 2012-2013, over 80 % of the participants had at least one cardiometabolic risk factor, including elevated blood pressure, elevated triglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and prediabetes. Therefore, understanding the underlying cardiometabolic mechanisms relevant to PFAS is crucial for the development of preventive strategies and targeted interventions against cardiometabolic outcomes. Prior in vitro and in vivo animal research has helped elucidate the mechanisms of PFAS toxicity on cardiometabolic health. One prominent mechanism involves peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs).

Mixtures were identified by the presence of a '.' separator in the SMILES string, indicating multiple molecular components, and were subsequently removed. Lastly, duplicate entries were eliminated to maintain data integrity. After preprocessing, the training set comprised 1486 compounds, with an imbalance of 1257 inactive and 229 active instances.

During this inflammatory pain state, endogenous opioid signaling is increased, such that administration of the MOR antagonist naloxone unmasks the inflammation-induced pain phenotype. This phenomenon is termed latent sensitization and has received further investigation in the context of post-operative pain. How CFA inflammatory pain impacts vlPAG opioidergic circuitry has not been thoroughly investigated, however. Previous microdialysis studies revealed that enkephalin release begins to rise within hours after induction of inflammation with CFA. In contrast, recent evidence indicates that MOR-expressing vlPAG neurons become hyperexcitable in response to acute thermal radiant heat stimulation within three days immediately following inflammation onset. We confirmed and extended this latter result in the dynamic thermal plate assay. By 3 days post-CFA we observed a substantial increase in noxious heat-related MOR neuron activity; however, by 3 weeks post-CFA, vlPAG MOR neurons displayed pre-injury-like activity in response to the noxious temperature range of the test. With administration of naltrexone, we found that inflammatory thermal hypersensitivity was reversed, consistent with a tonic, elevated enkephalin tone in vlPAG following CFAinduced inflammation.

Second, human exposome in the environment is complex and evolving, while epidemiological studies mainly focus on representative chemicals and certain exposure periods. Such inherent discrepancies limited the extrapolation power of AOP. Furthermore, since exposure to chemicals including DEHP and BPA during pregnancy have major impacts on the brain development of offspring, caution should be placed when using these two AOPs. In addition, epidemiological exposure assessment for BPA and DEHP primarily relies on urinary specimen by a single time-point measurement, which perhaps is not accurate enough to represent the actual exposure burden of these two chemicals and their metabolites. Therefore, future temporal and follow-up studies are required for further validation of our findings.

Two studies on Cyp found induction of MN in mice, although a negative report has also been published. Both positive and negative findings were likewise obtained in the mouse MN test for Del. Per weakly induced MN in mice. From the available published data, it appears that the genotoxicity of these pyrethroids seems not to be modulated by animal metabolic activation. With reference to carcinogenesis studies, Del and Fev were not carcinogenic in mice and rats, whereas Fev showed a weak positivity in mice hepatocytes. The findings of the present study using the CBMN assay in human lymphocytes appear to suggest that pyrethroid insecticides have a weak (cypermethrin, deltamethrin and fenpropathrin) or nule (fenvalerate and permethrin) genotoxic potential in vitro. The slight MN induction observed for Del in WB and IL cultures of one donor appears to support the weak in vitro genotoxicity of Del, earlier suggested by modest SCE induction in human lymphocytes. Fep and Cyp seemed to resemble Del in their ability to weakly induce MN. Fep has not previously tested in cytogenetic assays in vitro, while Cyp was earlier found to be negative in the SCE and CA test in human lymphocytes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Cypermethrin\",\"KE\",\"increase of MN in IL cultures\"\n\"Fenvalerate\",\"KE\",\"no significant MN induction\"\n\"Permethrin\",\"KE\",\"slight MN increase (single donor)\""}]}

Using immunostaining with anti-MAP2 antibody, we focused on GFPpositive and MAP2-positive cells, including all types of neurons in culture (Fig. S1). The administration of DM increased changes in neurite structures (Fig. 2). To quantify the structural changes, we performed a Sholl analysis, enabling us to detect changes in neurite complexity by measuring the number of crossings between neurites and circles with different diameters. As shown in Fig. 2A, B, and C, addition of DM increased the number of crossings in cultures harvested 6 h after the incubation, indicating that DM promotes neurite complexity. We also measured total length of neurites using Image J software and found that DM increased the length of neurites (Fig. 2D). Since DM increases neuronal excitability through its effect on VSSC that depolarizes the membrane and subsequently openings of L-VDCC that cause the influxof Ca 2 þ into neurons, we examined the effect of blockade of Ca influx via L-VDCC or activation of GABA receptors on the DM-induced increase in neurite complexity and length.

Glyphosate is a non - selective organophosphorus herbicide and it has bioaccumulation potential in the environment. Glyphosate exposure causes toxic effects in mammalians by increasing oxidative stress levels. Due to its common usage, this pesticide residue can be found in food and environmental samples. The main toxicity mechanism of glyphosate increases the emergence of ROS and causes disruption on cellular macromolecules by ROS. Chlorpyrifos is another widely used broad-spectrum organophosphorus insecticide. It has been reported that chlorpyrifos might have some toxic effects on organs and systems. Its common toxic effect is on the nervous system by acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition. Its main toxic effect mechanism is associated with cellular oxidative stress increment. Deltamethrin is part of the potent pyrethroid class of insecticides and acaricides. Also, deltamethrin has been used for controlling human diseases caused by mosquitos that are vectors of Zika virus and Dengue virus. It has been reported that deltamethrin exerts its toxic effects by increasing cellular ROS and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Oxidative stress remarkably increases the deltamethrin toxicity mechanism. Oxidative stress is a cellular imbalance condition which is formed between free radical production and the antioxidant defense system. Several chemicals may cause free radical production and through this, these radicals interact with important cellular molecules and impair their functions pathologically."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"glyphosate\",\"KE\",\"Bioaccumulation potential in the environment\"\n\"chlorpyrifos\",\"KE\",\"Cellular oxidative stress increment\"\n\"chlorpyrifos\",\"AO\",\"Toxic effects on organs and systems\"\n\"deltamethrin\",\"KE\",\"ROS and reactive nitrogen species generation\"\n\"glyphosate\",\"KE\",\"ROS-mediated disruption of cellular macromolecules\"\n\"chlorpyrifos\",\"MIE\",\"Acetylcholinesterase inhibition in nervous system\"\n\"deltamethrin\",\"KE\",\"Oxidative stress enhancement of toxicity mechanism\"\n\"glyphosate\",\"KE\",\"Increase of oxidative stress levels in mammals\"\n\"pirimiphos-methyl\",\"AO\",\"Harmful developmental, reproductive, and immune effects\""}]}

Alkyl esters attached to the nitrogen atom can be useful in the formation of bicyclic structures, including indolizidines. Such groups are also tolerated in the reaction, and we obtained 5e -5g in good yields. Thioformamides are rarely reported in the metal-catalyzed coupling of thioamides and diazo compounds. However, they gave good yields of coupled products ( 5h and 5i ). Biologically important compounds could also be modi  ed through this coupling. Thus monothiodicarboximide, which is the monothioimide-derivative of the anticonvulsant Phensuximide, could be converted into 5j in moderate yield, and the starting material could not be consumed entirely a  er 24 h. As was for 5d, we suspect that this lower yield is due to the sterically hindered nature of the thioamide ( 3j ). Finally, the thioamide analog of the insecticide DEET ( 3k ) could also be converted into ( 5k ). In this case, no reaction was observed at 40 C, and the reaction required heating at 110 C to get a reasonable yield.

Each individual membrane protein target was assigned values corresponding to the binding values of their unique row and column pools.

As a result, both human microglia cell lines showed a lack of TNFα expression even after LPS stimulation. In contrast, hiMG exhibited substantial increases in the expression of various pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNFα, highlighting its superiority as an in vitro model that accurately reflects in vivo adult human microglial function. The differing reactions to LPS across various microglia models may be attributed to their developmental stage, the unique genetic backgrounds from the donor, and how they were engineered for indefinite growth, all of which contribute to distinct patterns of cytokine secretion. Conversely, the immortalized murine BV2 microglial model exhibited a distinct cytokine expression profile, characterized by a marked increase in several cytokines while failing to produce detectable levels of interleukins or TNFα following LPS stimulation. This disparity complicates the extrapolation of this murine system to concordant human microglial responses, raising concerns regarding its utility. Despite BV2's long-standing use in studies of neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative disorders, including AD and PD, our findings resonate with the growing consensus that human-derived microglial models, such as hiMG, provide a more reliable platform for studying human-specific inflammatory responses compared to conventional murine models."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"LPS\",\"KE\",\"Interleukins and TNF-α undetectable in BV2 after LPS\"\n\"LPS\",\"KE\",\"Increased cytokines in BV2 (mouse microglia)\""}]}

The genome-wide expression analysis of rat tubular renal cells by Pallet et al. showed that CsA induced ER stress activity. They also observed that CsA treatment in renal-transplant patients associates with the upregulation of immunoglobulin-binding protein, an ER stress marker, in kidney-transplant biopsies. A large-scale study that tests the ability of immunoglobulin-binding protein to serve as an early CsA nephrotoxicity biomarker in transplant patients is warranted. Pallet et al. then showed that CsA-induced ER stress triggers EMT-like phenotypic changes in human tubular cells and their death, and that these effects can be prevented by salubrinal, which protects against ER stress. Notably, the ability of CsA to suppress T-cell activation is also mediated by its ability to induce ER stress and oxidative stress; these effects lead to the apoptosis of T cells. These observations suggest that CsA induces nephrotoxicity by activating an ER-specific apoptotic pathway, and that ER stress may be a factor that predicts nephrotoxicity and its clinical outcomes. ROS production in mitochondrion and oxidative stress have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of renal diseases, including IgAN and chronic kidney disease.

Akhtar reported that Tac causes structural distortion of the lungs in rats, characterized by alveolar cells necrosis, bronchiolar wall thickening, and interstitial round cell infiltration, which confirms the toxic potential of Tac in lungs.

Neurons then migrate alongside the scaffold of RG to theirfinal destinations, to generate the different cortical layers. The generation of sufficient numbers of neurons is a prerequisite for the functionality of neuronal networks and associated learning and memory functions. Therefore, disturbed neurogenesis manifests in several behavioral disorders such as depression or the intellectual disabilities of patients with Down Syndrome. In addition, an elevation in neurogenesis is a major driver of epileptogenesis. Hence, the correct balance of neurogenesis is crucial for normal brain development. As a very simplified model, the Neurosphere Assay mimics cortex development in vitro since during the time-course of hNPC differentiation, neurons arise and migrate along the scaffold of RG cells. Such young neurons are typically bipolar in shape and display neurites that show very limited branching. Using high content imaging (HCI) and a subsequent artificial intelligence (AI; developed in collaboration with Prof. Dr. Axel Mosig (Ruhr University Bochum), Förster et al., 2021) we define neuronal identity in the mixed-culture neurosphere migration area due to immunocytochemical stainings with β (III)tubulin ( Figure 4A )."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

These studies revealed that AD-214 is not cytotoxic at the concentrations tested as determined by measuring the total protein content of the test wells using the binding of sulforhodamine B (SRB) to cellular proteins (SRB marker in Figure 4, p > 0.05). AD-214 was active in both small airway epithelial cell/ differentiated lung myofibroblast co-culture lung (SAEMyoF) and renal (REMyoF) systems and had little activity in the MyoF monoculture system (Figure 4), indicating that AD214 primarily impacts epithelial cell biology or the paracrine signaling that occurs between epithelial cells and fibroblasts. In the lung system, AD-214 resulted in a decrease of the fibrosisrelated matrix markers collagen I and collagen III ( p < 0.01). In addition, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1), a chemokine that regulates recruitment of monocytes and T cells into the site of inflammation was significantly reduced. Common activities in both the lung and renal systems included a decrease in sIL-6 ( p < 0.01) and sIL-8 ( p < 0.01) expression. Interestingly, AD-214 differentially affected E-cadherin, a marker of epithelial cells that mediates cell-cell contact, in the two systems: expression was decreased in the lung system ( p < 0.01) and increased in the renal system ( p < 0.01)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"AD-214\",\"KE\",\"Not cytotoxic in BioMAP fibrosis panel\"\n\"AD-214\",\"KE\",\"Decreases E-cadherin in lung co-culture\"\n\"AD-214\",\"KE\",\"Increases E-cadherin in renal co-culture\"\n\"AD-214\",\"KE\",\"Decreases collagen I biomarker (lung fibrosis co-culture)\"\n\"AD-214\",\"KE\",\"Decreases collagen III biomarker (lung fibrosis co-culture)\"\n\"AD-214\",\"KE\",\"Decreases soluble IL-6\"\n\"AD-214\",\"KE\",\"Decreases soluble IL-8\""}]}

No transcription initiation site was detected using the primer specific to the 5 UTR of HL-1 clone. Two human BLT1 cDNAs, HL-1 and HL-5, were isolated, and were shown to share the same ORF, but different 5 UTRs (34). In Northern blotting of HL-60 and U937 cells, the probe containing the 5 UTR specific to HL-5 clone gave positive signals of z 1.6 kb and 3.0 kb (data not shown), which were similar to the results from the probe of the entire ORF (Fig. 5 D; reference 10). In contrast, the probe containing the 5 UTR specific to HL-1 clone gave no signals on the same membrane (data not shown), suggesting that HL-5 and not HL-1 is the major transcript of BLT1, at least in HL-60 and U937 cells.

Consequently, a neurotoxicity screening battery should consist of a range of endpoints to include additional neurotoxicological targets. For this study, PC12 cells were used because they express L, N, and P/Q-type VGCCs. The observed complete inhibition of VGCCs by insecticides thus indicates that the insecticides inhibit all VGCCs types present in PC12 cells. Calcium channels in PC12 cells are comparable with neurons, and PC12 cells are therefore a suitable model for screening for effects on VGCCs as a measure of neurotoxicity. Also, we show that primary rat cortical cells are a less sensitive cell model for the investigation of effects specifically on VGCC inhibition. Primary rat cortical cells constitute a physiologically relevant model and these heterogeneous cultures form spontaneously active neuronal networks. However, effects on VGCCs can be thus obscured due to interaction with additional targets. Many chemicals have additional targets, such as VGSCs in case of cypermethrin and GABA receptors in case of endosulfan, which may cause, eg, continues oscillations in basal [Ca ] that could interfere with the depolarization-evoked increase in [Ca 2 þ ]. For chlorpyrifos exposure, no continues oscillations in primary cortical cells were observed and effects of chlorpyrifos on VGCCs could be determined. These data show that chlorpyrifos induces a comparable rank order potency for the different exposure scenarios in PC12 cells and primary cortical cells."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"endosulfan\",\"KE\",\"Continuous oscillations in basal Ca2+ in primary cortical cells during acute exposure\"\n\"cypermethrin\",\"KE\",\"Continuous oscillations in basal Ca2+ in primary cortical cells during acute exposure\"\n\"endosulfan\",\"MIE\",\"Inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs)\"\n\"cypermethrin\",\"MIE\",\"Inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs)\""}]}

Several biomarkers of CsA nephrotoxicity in the urine and blood have already been established. They include urinary retinol-binding protein (RBP), which accurately predicts progressive CsA nephrotoxicity in heart-transplant patients. Moreover, microalbuminuria along with elevated urinary levels of kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, andfibronectin are indicative of acute CsA nephrotoxicity while high urinary osteopontin and transforming growth factor (TGF)β 1 levels may be potential biomarkers for chronic CsA nephrotoxicity. The levels of these urinary kidney injury biomarkers also correlate well with the temporal development of CsA nephrotoxicity. Potential biomarkers of CsA nephrotoxicity in the blood include indoxyl sulfate and nicotinamide adenosine diphosphate oxidase 2 (Nox2), both of which are significantly elevated in patients with CsA nephrotoxicity. Several very recent studies also suggest that several genetic elements, including microRNA494 (miR-494) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), could also serve as CsA nephrotoxicity biomarkers. The validation of these molecules as effective CsA nephrotoxicity biomarkers, and the identification of new biomarkers, will greatly help to rapidly diagnose CsA nephrotoxicity, thereby making the treatment much safer. At present, the cellular and molecular biological mechanisms underlying CsA nephropathy are not completely understood. However, a series of early and more recent studies suggest that an important mechanism is oxidative stress.

At DIV 7, spikes (black bars) were the sole form of activity, whereas at DIV 14, bursts (blue bars) started to form on single electrodes. Along with the increase in bursting activity and the emergence of a synchronous network starting on DIV 21, the number of spikes between network bursts decreased at DIV 28 and 35. This transition in network development is reflected by the evaluation of different network parameters of untreated solvent control wells (0.1% DMSO) from all plates contributing to this study (n = 41 plates and 123 wells). Figure 4B-E shows the distribution of different parameters between experiments (each data point reflects the median of 3 wells of each independent experiment) and indicates the variation of the hNNF assay. On DIV 7 and 14, the mean firing rate was notably below 5 Hz, but then rose to 10 Hz, with its peak at DIV 28 (Fig. 4B). The same trend was observed for the duration of bursts between DIV 7 and 35 (Fig. 4C). Nevertheless, some parameters, like the network burst percentage or the AUNCC, continuously increased until DIV 35 (Fig. 4D,E). Because the highly organized activity of the network is rarely observed at DIV 7 and 14 (Fig."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

However, the literature has proven that cypermethrin and other pyrethroids have carcinogenic, hepatotoxic, immunosuppressive, and neurotoxic effects on mammals. 14 -17 The toxicity of pyrethroid insecticides in mammals has received considerable attention in recent years, owing to the fact that exposure to these insecticides in animals altered their physiological activities, in addition to other pathological features. 18 Oxidative stress in cerebral and hepatic tissues was observed in rats after oral exposure of cypermethrin. 19 Synthetic pyrethroids may also disrupt hematological, reproductive, and biochemical parameters. 20 Hematological parameters are the most rapid and easily detectable variables that help in evaluating any health condition and at the same time, their importance in population Table 1.

Research has shown that exposure to phthalates is associated with various disorders, but most significantly with reproductive disorders. There is a worldwide trend towards increasing reproductive disorders, such as hormone-dependent cancers, infertility, and decreased fecundity. In 2015, 8-12% of couples worldwide were infertile or had decreased fecundity, and 6.7% of females were infertile. Over the last 50 years, the 32.5% decrease in sperm concentration in men has been remarkable. One of the causes of current reproductive disorders could be environmental chemicals, such as phthalates. It is essential to address the problem of an increase in fertility disorders. Characteristics of the mechanisms of phthalates' e GLYPH<11> ects are essential to solve this growing problem. However, in the present, there is not enough of this intricate knowledge. Therefore, we consider it necessary to create such a comprehensive overview of the topic. In this review, we attempted to present an overview of the current knowledge concerning the phthalates' e GLYPH<11> ect on reproductive health at multiple levels. This review integrates the results from in silico, in vitro, in vivo studies, and epidemiological studies to show the complexity of phthalates' e GLYPH<11> ects on reproduction. We summarized the knowledge of general reproductive regulators, phthalate toxicity, and phthalates' e GLYPH<11> ect on male and female reproduction at the clinical, hormonal, and intracellular levels. /gid00001 Thedevelopmentandfunctionsofthereproductivesystemareunderthecontrolofnumerousgenes.

For instance, activation of α7 nAChRs increases the presynaptic release of both glutamate and GABA, promoting the induction of long term potentiation (LTP). However, the specific effects on primary excitatory cells depend on the location and timing of receptor activation. For example, in CA1 interneurons, α7 nAChR activation may suppress the induction of short term potentiation in connected pyramidal neurons, whereas activation on CA1 dendrites in pyramidal neurons can enhance short term potentiation (STP) or LTP. These diverse effects highlight the complex regulatory role of α7 nAChRs in hippocampal synaptic plasticity, ultimately influencing learning, memory formation and cognition. Studies in both animal models and humans suggest that external activation of α7 nAChRs enhances synaptic plasticity, facilitates LTP and improves memory formation, while receptor antagonists are associated with impaired cognitive function. While neurons have been traditionally viewed as the central mediators of cognition, increasing evidence suggest the role of glial cells in modulating synaptic plasticity, learning and memory. Astrocytes regulate synaptic transmission by buffering extracellular ions, releasing neuromodulators and modulating local blood flow, thereby influencing neuronal excitability and network dynamics. Their ability to couple multiple synapses into functional assemblies suggests they may contribute to higher order information processing, including memory consolidation and network oscillations. Microglia actively prune synapses in an activity dependent manner, refining neural circuits to optimize cognitive function."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Dynamic, pain state-dependent interplay of nociceptive MOR function and enkephalin release in vlPAG. The primacy of vlPAG function in nociception and its ability to produce pain relief through endogenous opioid signaling is wellknown. Electrical stimulation of the vlPAG elicits release of the endogenous MOR agonist met-enkephalin and results in pain relief in both animals and humans that is, at least partially, blocked by MOR antagonists. Correspondingly, infusion of MOR agonists into the vlPAG also produces robust antinociception, suggesting that endogenous opioid inhibition of vlPAG MOR-expressing neurons may facilitate pain relief by suppressing nociceptive activation of the MOR+ population. Our data support this hypothesis. Here, we show that acute nociception corresponds with a coordinated population response in vlPAG MOR neurons, such that increasingly noxious stimulation elicits larger bulk calcium-related events. Nociceptive calciumrelated events in vlPAG MOR neurons corresponded with nocifensive behaviors in the dynamic thermal plate assay. Critically, this nocifensive neural activity was suppressed by peripheral morphine administration and raising the possibility that changes in endogenous opioid release may promote antinociceptive or pain-relieving inhibition of MOR+ cell types in vlPAG.

Deltamethrin belongs to the class of synthetic pyrethroids, which are being widely used as insecticides in agricultural practices. Voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) are the primary targets of these chemicals for toxicity to insects. Caenorhabditis elegans ( C. elegans ) does not have VGSCs but is susceptible to deltamethrin. Recentfindings have suggested that pyrethroids can affect voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). However, it remains elusive whether deltamethrin induces toxicity to C. elegans via modulating the activity of VGCCs. To identify the potential target of deltamethrin, we exposed C. elegans to different concentrations of deltamethrin and Ca 2+ channel blockers for different times, characterized the behavioral toxicity of deltamethrin on C. elegans, and determined the expression of egl -19, unc -2, and cca -1, which encode the α 1-subunit of the L, R/N/P/Q, and T-type VGCC, respectively."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"pyrethroids\",\"MIE\",\"Modulation of voltage-gated sodium channels\"\n\"pyrethroids\",\"MIE\",\"Interaction with VGCCs and chloride channels\"\n\"deltamethrin\",\"MIE\",\"Inhibition of multiple voltage-activated Ca2+ channels\""}]}

Calculation of network scalar perturbations Complex primary cultures isolated from newborn rat cortex exhibit a reproducible developmental trajectory as neurite outgrowth leads to synaptogenesis and increasing network activity over approximately two weeks in vitro. mwMEA recordings over this time period provide multiparametric data that includes measures of spike, burst, and network synchrony in each culture. Our previous work demonstrated that many compounds that are developmentally neurotoxic in mammals perturb these parameters. Because of the temporal nature of our previous data, it was possible to determine a critical concentration at which a given compound began to perturb the developing system beyond recovery. Such concentrations may represent the transition point in the series of events that results in developmental neurotoxicity. To determine these tipping points, it wasfirst necessary to transform network parameter data into values that define a distance from normal activity range."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Our data set, focusing on TPO inhibitors and derived from the U.S. EPA, shows a 1:6 ratio of active to inactive samples. 23 This imbalance is a frequent issue in toxicity prediction studies, often tackled through undersampling the majority class, though this approach risks losing valuable information. Effective sampling techniques are crucial to accurately reflect these data dynamics. To address this, some researchers use oversampling to increase the presence of minority class samples, though this can sometimes cause overfitting. 63 In our approach, we applied k -subset specifically to the majority class (nontoxic compounds) to address the class imbalance present in the data set."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

It is widely used in agriculture, forestry, and household products because of some favorable properties such as wide spectrum, relatively low mammalian toxicity, and rapid biodegradability. However, widespread application of pyrethroids has caused to toxic effects in plants, animals, and human beings. Cypermethrin has been reported to exert carcinogenic activity in both sexes of Swiss albino mice. It has been suggested that cypermethrin causes free radical-mediated damage in erythrocytes and brain and liver tissues. The genotoxic and/or cytotoxic potential of cypermethrin has been shown in previous studies. It slightly increased the number of micronucleated cells in whole blood lymphocyte cultures in human. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that cypermethrin induces chromosomal aberrations and micronucleus formation in mouse bone marrow and spleen. The 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), a chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbon acid pesticide, has been in extensive use since 1944, in agriculture for broad-leaved weeds, control of woody plants, and reforestation programs. It is classified as group II-B carcinogenic agent by IARC. Major target organ systems of 2,4-D toxicity are the central nervous system and the cardiovascular system.

To keep the exposure design consistent, the 19 pesticides were split into 'batch 1' chemicals consisting of 9 pesticides and 3,4-DCA, and 'batch 2' chemicals consisting of the subsequent 10 pesticides (Supporting Information, Figure S1B). On exposure Day 1, cells were seeded at a density of 35,000 cells/100 µ L of complete medium/well in 96-well plates and incubated for 24 h. In each plate, 11 wells were designated as no-cell controls and contained only the complete medium. On Day 2, the complete medium was discarded and replaced with 100 µ L of L-15/ex for the negative control (one well), or L-15/ex containing either the pesticide, solvent (DMSO), or positive control (3,4-DCA) at appropriate concentrations (one concentration/well)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Moreover, a study on human colonic cells has shown similar results that phosphorylated protein expression levels of p38 MAPK, ERK, JNK, and AKT are significantly inhibited in BPA-exposed cells, warranting further study. IL-17 has an intensive relation with the MAPK signaling pathway in inflammatory response, whereas BPA can raise MIE when constructing new AOPs. KE1 was selected based on bioinformatics analysis results and literature evidence: MAPK1 was a collective gene extracted by literature screening and Venn analysis. MAPK signaling pathway has been recognized as an important route in the cardiovascular system. BPA can increase the phosphorylated form of protein, including p-AKT(Ser473) and p-AKT(T308). An in vivo study has found that exposure to BPA significantly increases the expression of IL-17A in the heart. Additionally, membrane-associated ER α and ER β, when bound by estrogen, can each activate a signaling cascade that includes PI3K and AKT, as well as ERK L. Zhang et al.

All such improvements could be envisaged by considering other data sources (eg, joint pathways analysis from cross-omics studies and databases such as Effectopedia and the human toxome knowledgebase). Compared with BPA, the effects of BPF on human health are poorly characterized. Most studies focused on its physiological and endocrine activities. Few models have been used to characterize such effects in humans; for example, a fetal testis assay developed in 3 different species (mouse, rat, human) showed that nanomolar concentrations of BPA, BPS, and BPF are able to reduce basal testosterone secretion in the human ex vivo model. This ex vivo study suggested that as for BPA, BPF acts as an endocrine disruptor in humans. Such results are supported by in vitro studies using human cell lines which indicate estrogenic and antiandrogenic effects of BPF. In addition to such endocrine-disrupting effects, our approach has suggested a link between BPF and cell proliferation. The putative effect on thyroid cancer appeared to be the most significant 1 and this was highlighted in the AOP model that is presented. Relevant initiating events were identified including inhibition of PPAR c and activation of ERa. Overall, these results could be used as the basis for further epidemiological and experimental studies, thus providing additional evidence for causal links between BPF and tumor development."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"BPF\",\"KE\",\"Antiandrogenic effects in human cell lines\"\n\"BPF\",\"KE\",\"Estrogenic effects in human cell lines\"\n\"BPF\",\"KE\",\"Reduced basal testosterone secretion (human ex vivo fetal testis model)\"\n\"BPF\",\"MIE\",\"Inhibition of catalase\"\n\"BPF\",\"KE\",\"Absence of activation of TRAIL\"\n\"BPF\",\"KE\",\"Absence of inhibition of E2F/DP and PP2A\"\n\"BPF\",\"KE\",\"Absence of inhibition of cyclin D1 by catalase\"\n\"BPF\",\"KE\",\"Absence of inhibition of Cyclin D1/Cdk4 complex by p27\""}]}

The capacity of hiMG cells to integrate and respond to multiple inflammatory stimuli, including interferon and TLR-agonist stimulation, allows for a more nuanced investigation of synergistic or antagonistic pathway interactions that drive neuroinflammatory pathogenesis. This sophisticated responsiveness makes the hiMG model an invaluable tool for accurately identifying and characterizing environmental toxicants or therapeutic compounds that modulate neuroinflammation, better reflecting the complex and polymodal nature of inflammation within the CNS during disease states. Additionally, the interaction of catecholamines with microglial cells adds complexity to our understanding of neuroinflammation. Previous studies suggest that catecholamines can modulate microglial activation and cytokine production. For example, peripheral treatment with ADR antagonists (e.g., prazosin, propranolol) has been shown to block cytokine response in various structures of the CNS, and ADRB activation correlates with IL-1 β mRNA expression, with evidence positing microglia as a primary source of IL-1 β. However, in vitro studies indicate that stimulation of microglial adrenergic receptor ligands can exert anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced microglia cells. This is attributed to a reduction in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, superoxide anions, and nitric oxide by microglia. However, the specific effects of catecholamines on cytokine expression in microglia cells remain inadequately characterized."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"LPS\",\"MIE\",\"Toll-like receptor agonist stimulation\""}]}

Thus, miR-494 plays a key role in CsA-induced EMT and nephrotoxicity by downregulating PTEN. This study suggests miR-494 in the kidney may be a useful biomarker of CsA nephrotoxicity. Moreover, strategies that block miR-494 expression may be a novel way to prevent this disease. Notably, González-Guerrero et al. showed very recently that TLR4 is a potential pharmacological target in CsA nephrotoxicity. They found that CsA treatment induced renal TLR4 expression in wild-type mice and that targeting TLR4 pharmacologically or genetically inhibited the CsA-induced activation of the proinflammatory JNK/c-jun, JAK2/STAT3, IRE1 α, and NFκ B signaling pathways. Inhibiting TLR4 also reduced CsA-induced tubular damage and markedly suppressed the development of kidneyfibrosis. Thus, the TLR4 gene may be an important biomarker and pharmacological target in CsA nephrotoxicity. Moreover, since Xiao et al. found that angiotensin II and the NO and ER pathways are novel treatment targets in chronic CsA nephrotoxicity and Cheng et al. showed that Bip/Grp78 regulates CsA-induced tubular vacuolization, these molecules may also be biomarkers of CsA nephrotoxicity. In summary, the identification of potential biomarkers of CsA nephrotoxity has become an importantfield of research in the last decade because these biomarkers could aid the early detection of CsA nephrotoxity and facilitate the safer and more rational use of CsA. Thisfield of research also enhances our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie CsA nephrotoxicity."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"Blocking miR-494 abrogated EMT\"\n\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"TLR4 expression induced by CsA in mice\"\n\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"Tubular damage reduced when TLR4 inhibited\"\n\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"Proinflammatory signaling activation linked to TLR4\"\n\"CsA\",\"AO\",\"Kidney fibrosis suppressed when TLR4 inhibited\""}]}

To comprehensively represent molecular information, we incorporated 12 diverse molecular fingerprints to generate OOF predictions for the stacked model. These fingerprints span four major categories, each capturing distinct aspects of molecular structure: predefined substructures, topology-derived substructures, electrotopological state indices, and atom pair relationships. Previous studies have successfully applied these features in traditional ML models for skin cell toxicity prediction. More recently, another study applied CNN, BiLSTM, and attention mechanism with these fingerprints for thyroid toxicity prediction, although it ultimately selected only a subset of the most informative features. In contrast, our approach retains all 12 fingerprints to preserve the full spectrum of structural information and to explore the capacity of deep learning models to capture complex interfeature interactions. Then we trained this model with strategic data sampling by dividing the training data set into k -ratios (Figure 1C) for achieving balanced data distribution among toxic and nontoxic compounds. After that we utilized AL framework (Figure 1D) to reduce data needed to archieve a high performance predictive model.

Adverse outcome pathway networks can also be used for assay development and refinement, as shown in a study that created an AOP network for reproductive and developmental toxicity in fish, based on 5 relevant existing AOPs. A recently developed stressor-AOP network webserver, integrating information from the ToxCast and AOP-wiki databases, revealed that many chemical stressors can putatively interfere with 1 or several AOPs. Due to the rapidly expanding available toxicology data (including omics), data-driven and computer-based tools are now believed to be a realistic option for the development of nonanimal-based hazard and risk assessment. Pipelines for generating and enriching AOP descriptions including literature mining and integration of diverse data sources have been proposed recently. Such integrative approach is essentially qualitative, and will be improved in the future to generate more quantitative models, that will take into consideration dose and time effects. A next step would be to include, for example, the dose-dependent activation of MIEs or detailed pathways of toxicity.

' Indeed, PPAR γ activation is a known initiating event for increased adipogenesis. PPAR γ also is known to be involved in the regulation of adipocyte differentiation and has been implicated in several pathologies including obesity, diabetes, and cancer.

At the stationary stage of growth yeast cells are more resistant to the effects of toxic factors, presumably because the activity of antioxidant enzymes is greater than in the logarithmic phase. Pyrethroids can affect cells by generating oxidant stress.

EC x is the concentration of the mixture resulting in an effect of x % relative to control, EC x is the concentration of component i resulting in an effect of x % when applied in isolation, and p is the proportion of the total concentration of the mixture (in molar terms) represented by component i. Whether the toxicity of each mixture conformed to CA was determined using a two-step process. First, if the observed mixture toxicity value fell within the 95% confidence intervals of the expected value of a model then the mixture was considered to have conformed to the model. If, however, an observed mixture toxicity value was outside the 95% confidence intervals of the expected value then the mixture potentially may not conform to that model. To enable a quantitative estimation of the difference in predicted and measured toxicities, the model deviation ratio (MDR) method was used. For the CA model, the MDR was derived by dividing the predicted toxicity value (EC ) by the observed toxicity value. The MDR values greater than 1.3 mean that the toxicity of the mixture conforms with synergism while values less than 0.7 are taken to conform to antagonism The MDR approach has been successfully applied by other researchers."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Disruption to mitochondrial metabolism lowers mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) efficiency, increasing ROS and hindering ATP generation. One study highlighted the central role of the mitochondria in cisplatin nephrotoxicity and how disruption to its function induced oxidative stress, redox state unbalance and energy metabolism impairment to induce apoptotic cell death resulting in kidney failure. Cisplatin has been shown to target tubular epithelial cell mitochondria to induce structural and functional damage, increase ROS levels, and decrease GSH and superoxide dismutase activity. Cisplatin activates p38 MAPK through multiple mechanisms, including TLR4-mediated signalling and oxidative stress. In kidney proximal tubules, cisplatin-induced mitochondrial DNA damage releases damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that bind TLR4 on parenchymal cells, triggering p38 phosphorylation. A positive correlation between cellular density of mitochondria and cisplatin-induced toxicity has also been reported. Intracellular aquated Pt drugs react rapidly with GSH and is then transported to the inner membrane. The electrochemical gradient formed from negatively charged mitochondria may explain the rapid accumulation of positively charged cisplatin. Cisplatin-induced AKI reduces both mitochondria and peroxisome number and function, resulting in elevated ROS levels and apoptosis of PTECs. Perturbations of mitochondrial energy metabolism, increased mtROS production and apoptotic cell death have all been described as features of cisplatin-induced AKI."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Cisplatin\",\"KE\",\"Reduction in mitochondria and peroxisome number/function with elevated ROS and apoptosis\"\n\"Cisplatin\",\"KE\",\"Release of mtDNA damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) binding TLR4\"\n\"Cisplatin\",\"KE\",\"Mitochondrial structural and functional damage; decreased GSH and SOD activity\"\n\"Cisplatin\",\"KE\",\"Peroxisome reduction leading to ROS accumulation and tubular cell apoptosis\"\n\"Cisplatin\",\"KE\",\"Intrinsic apoptosis (BAX/BAK1 oligomerization; mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization)\""}]}

According to EFSA, CPF elicits oxidative stress in various tissue and cell types, which results in damage to all vital macromolecules, including proteins, lipids, and DNA. Thus, oxidative DNA damage can be followed by DNA single and double-strand breaks, which may also interact with biological molecules to disrupt normal DNA synthesis and repair, influencing the mRNA expression profiles in brain cells. As suggested by Ojha et al., 24 h post-treatment, acute and chronic exposure to CPF caused significantly marked DNA damage in rat tissues, namely the brain, liver, spleen, and kidney. In turn, in a study using fetal liver hematopoietic stem cells, Lu et al. observed that CPF can also cause DNA damage through topoisomerase II inhibition. The epidemiological studies conducted by Hern á ndez and Menendez noted an important association between CPF exposure and infant leukemia. Thus, exposure to CPF in dam rats may lead to neurobehavioral impairments in offspring. The results obtained by Serpa et al. confirm the genotoxic potential of CPF.

Studies on the effects of CPF on developmental toxicity in animals such as rats, rabbits, and mice indicate that rats are the most sensitive animals. At the highest doses of CPF, inhibition of AChE activity in erythrocytes regarding maternal toxicity increased post-implantation loss in rats while in rabbit, decreased fetal size and increased postimplantation loss occurred, whereas in mice, no developmental toxicity potential was determined. In turn, no negative developmental effects were observed in rabbits and rats after exposure to CPF. On this basis, it was concluded that CPF does not function as an endocrine disruptor in humans. All experts agree that there is no need for an assessment of endocrine disruptors in humans after exposure to CPF. Such a decision was made because in all the analyzed studies in animals, NOAEL (no observed adverse effect level), LOAEL (lowest observable adverse effect level), and MTD (maximum tolerated dose) for this pesticide were established on the basis of inhibition of AChE activity in erythrocytes and clinical symptoms were observed only at the high doses of this compound.

It is a leading cause for acute liver failure. Importantly, with the advent of omics platforms and high-throughput technologies a plethora of diverse data have become available to significantly advance the field of toxicological sciences. Given that 'omics and NGS' platform technologies enable the capturing of whole genome/proteome information, the findings permit the construction of circuitries within a cell, tissue and organ in response to specific treatments across different species. Yet, turning data into knowledge remains a fundamental challenge.

Low CPF doses of 1/10 LD50 applied to the skin resulted in decreased levels of neurotoxicity. In the initial phase of neurotoxicity, a glial reaction in the form of GFAP expression was observed as a result of the shorter application of a low CPF dose to the skin. Taking into account the above studies and their results, skin exposure to CPF should be avoided. The results obtained from field studies with applicators and residents have shown that exposure to CPF may occur as a result of its widespread use, both outdoors and indoors. Inevitably, professional workers are exposed unintentionally and unavoidably as evidenced by the presence of 3,5,6-TCP in urine, which was observed in workers dealing with the application of CPF. Many research studies have been devoted to the effects of CPF on skin exposure in people working with this substance and children.

Because diazepam usually but not in every case, decreased activity to cessation, the change in MFR weighted against number of AEs is skewed. Thus, in cases like diazepam, it is useful to also consider the number of AEs as a metric to detect a hit. For most of the compounds in the training set, the changes in activity were not associated with changes in cell viability, as only four compounds caused viability changes. Fluoxetine caused /C24 95% of the cells to be PI positive in the 30 min test period, while fipronil, lindane and methylmercury caused measurable, but not complete cytotoxicity. It is more difficult to determine the contribution of this cytotoxicity to the changes in activity observed with these compounds. While the PI assay does provide information about non-viable cells in the network, without additional counterstaining for neurons and glia, it is not possible to determine whether the cytotoxicity is occurring evenly across these two different cell types or if one is more vulnerable than the other."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

For pesticides, maximum residue levels (MRLs) are established for food and drinking water to ensure the health of living organisms. As observed in the study by Jankowska et al., CPF residues in drinking water and food often occur at relatively low detected values, which makes dietary risk assessment difficult. Therefore, it was available for a long period of time before decisions were made to withdraw it from the market because of its toxicity. Solomon et al. indicated that pesticides such as CPF tend to accumulate in food products, and their universality regarding uses on various agricultural crops contributes to a significant share in the human diet. In addition, the rate of absorption by organisms after ingestion with food and water poses a toxicological threat. The studies conducted by Yuan et al. and Slotkin show that CPF is one of the most frequently detected pesticides in food, with the highest rate of 38.3%. It is well known that food quality is closely related to the place of origin and environmental pollution. Even low concentrations of pesticides, i.e., below the acceptable residue limit (MRL), in food can cause negative health effects, especially when the exposure is prolonged over time.

The effect size of our findings is relatively small, however, this is quite a common finding in environmental epigenetic studies. Early-life exposures typically produce relatively small effects on DNA methylations while large magnitude epigenetic effect sizes may be incompatible with continued development. Thus, we maximized data reliability via stringent quality control and data processing procedures. Despite these potential limitations, our study identified substantial and consistent first trimester DNA methylation changes associated to phthalate exposures. These methylation changes are associated with gene expression changes, in particular for EGFR, and need to be further evaluated in larger cohorts for their potential role as mechanistic links, biomarkers, and therapeutic targets. Confirmation and expansion of these findings in other populations, with additional environmental data as well as studies of the mechanistic basis for altered DNA methylation, will provide valuable insights into the epigenetic mechanisms modulating fetal development. Although future studies are needed to determine the functional consequences of these changes in gene expression, our report is consistent with the model that phthalates impact placental function by modulating the expression of critical placental genes through epigenetic regulation. In humans, this sensitive developmental window coincides with the earliest age of pregnancy at a time when it is not yet clinically recognized."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

ARs are found throughout the body, including in the vascular smooth muscle, vascular endothelium, on presynaptic nerve terminals, and on a subset of immune cells. There are a number of subtypes based on physiologic function, pharmacology, structure, and signal transduction (Fig. 2). The function of a -ARs in the skin is primarily to regulate blood flow through vasoconstriction following catecholamine binding to receptors on vascular smooth muscle, where the mobilization of calcium stores results in muscle cell contraction. Detailed molecular mechanisms of ARs are described elsewhere. a -ARs are divided into a and a subtypes. The relative contribution of a and a subtypes in subcutaneous vessels can vary with location, receptor density, local NE concentration, and temperature. The density of arterial a -ARs increases from proximal to distal location, and a -ARs are thought to dominate in small vessels ( \\ 200 microns). Expression of a -ARs on non-smooth muscle cells can also mediate receptor function. Within the vasculature, a -ARs on endothelial cells relax blood vessels by release of nitric oxide (NO), an effect opposite that of ARs on vascular smooth muscle. Presynaptic nerve terminals likewise express a -ARs and induce vasorelaxation by inhibiting release of NE and, subsequently, adrenergic neurotransmission via a negative feedback function."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Increased cell loss perturbs the surrounding environment, in turn activating inflammatory responses which further exacerbates this KE. In most patient cases reporting kidney tubular necrosis, apoptosis was the most common type of cell death, followed by necrosis. It has been established that cisplatin nephrotoxicity is dose-dependent and can induce apoptosis at low doses, and both regulated and unregulated necrosis of kidney cells at higher doses. Yet, cisplatin has also been shown to induce both apoptosis and necrosis in vivo. High concentrations cause heavy necrotic damage localised to the PTECs as it reabsorbs filtered molecules. Necrotic cell death is traditionally characterised by passive, unregulated swelling and rupture or cells, and activation of a robust inflammatory response. However, it has been established that several forms of regulated necrosis involving different molecular pathways also exist, among them necroptosis and ferroptosis, have both been implicated in cisplatin nephrotoxicity (Fig. 5). Necroptosis occurs within the Ripoptosome complex, comprising RIP1, FADD, and procaspase-8. Receptor-interacting serine threonine kinase 1 (RIPK1) activation within the complex leads to RIPK3 activation, promoting mixed lineage kinase domain-like proteins (MLKL) phosphorylation.

Per was earlier also shown to produce CA and, marginally, SCE in human lymphocytes. However, taking into account that weak genotoxicity is difficult todemonstrate, especially if it occurs within a narrow and toxic concentration range, the results obtained with Cyp, Del and Fep are not necessarily in desagreement with those already published in the literature. Several variables can affect the reproducibility and the sensitivity of the in vitro CBMN assay, including methodology, interindividual variability and the source, chemical composition and purity of the compound to be tested. The methodological aspects mainly include Cyt-B concentration, the presence or absence of erythrocytes in the lymphocyte culture and treatment schedule.

While p S640p107 is rapidly dephosphorylated (Fig. 4j-l,o), the dephosphorylation of p S615p107 is comparatively slow, with little to no dephosphorylation observed until p S640p107 is almost completely dephosphorylated (Fig. 4l-n and Extended Data Figs. 7 and 8). These results are fully consistent with the cryo-EM structure of the PP2A:B55p107 substrate complex. Specifically, S615 p107 binds directly to B55 in a pocket more than 40 Å away from the PP2Ac active site, making it unable to be dephosphorylated when bound to B55. In contrast, S640 p107 is positioned next to the PP2Ac active site when bound to B55, making it ideally located for rapid dephosphorylation. Together, these data suggest that pS640 is the primary phosphosite targeted by PP2A:B55. While p107 bound B55 as predicted, the lack of the B55-specific SHelM in Eya3, coupled with the lack of a preferred secondary structure in the unbound state (Extended Data Fig. 3a), suggested that it may bind B55 through a distinct mechanism. The structure of PP2A:B55-Eya3 confirms that Eya3 binds B55 in an extended rather than helical manner (Fig. 5a).

The environment is contaminated with phthalates. Phthalates were found in samples of soil (0.03-1280 mg / kg), in drinking water samples (0.16-170 µ g / dm ), in samples of air ( < 0.4-65 ng / m ), and in dust samples (2.38-4.1 g / kg). Humans can be exposed to phthalates via di GLYPH<11> erent ways-via food intake, by inhalation, intravenously, and through dermal contact. Dermal absorption is a more critical type of exposure for LMWP and ingestion for HMWP. Moreover, they are capable of transplacental transition, and therefore they can exert their toxic e GLYPH<11> ects within embryonic and fetal development. Therefore, phthalates can alter the development of reproductive systems. A critical developmental window for reproductive system development is during gonadogenesis (5th-18th week of gestation). However, the functional maturation of the reproductive system lasts until adolescence. Phthalates as EDs can impair the development of the genital system during prenatal as well as the postnatal period of ontogenesis. Phthalate metabolism consists of two parts of biotransformation: hydrolysis and conjugation.

Phthalates can induce the puberty onset alternation and cancer occurrence in both females and males. In males, phthalates can induce testicular dysgenesis syndrome (TDS), which is connected with impaired spermatogenesis. In females, the exposure to phthalates can induce premature ovarian failure (POF), which is linked with impaired oogenesis and folliculogenesis. These reproductive disorders are mainly associated with a disrupted HPG axis that a GLYPH<11> ects the process of steroidogenesis in both males as well as females. The activity of genes regulating reproduction can modulate steroidogenesis. These genes can be modulated by the activity of peptide and nuclear receptors (NR). Phthalates impair the peptide receptors and NR. Phthalates alter cell proliferation and apoptosis via crosstalk between MAPK, NF-kB, PI3K / Akt, and NR. This can lead to impaired spermatogenesis and cancer occurrence. At the intracellular level, phthalates act via interaction with the signaling of membrane receptors GnRHR, LHR, FSHR, which regulate steroidogenesis. Phthalates modulate levels of Ca2 + levels in the gonadal cells to disrupt the maturation and activation of these cells. Moreover, they can interfere with nuclear receptors, e.g., AR, ER, PPAR, as the agonists and antagonists.

They speculated that when evaluating chronic CsA nephropathy in pediatric patients with frequently relapsing SDNS, repeated serum indoxyl sulfate measurements could be used instead of repeated renal biopsies. In addition, the prospective study of live related renal-allograft recipients by Naqvi et al. showed that fractional excretion of serum magnesium is a useful marker of CsA toxicity that is independent of CsA blood levels. Recently, Djamali et al. provided several lines of evidence that suggested that Nox2 plays an important role in CsA-induced chronic hypoxia. First, chemical and genetic inhibition of Nox2 in rats abrogated CsA-induced hypoxia independently of regional perfusion. Second, Nox2 knockout associated with less oxidative stress andfi-brogenesis. Third, liver-transplant recipients with chronic CsA nephrotoxicity exhibited significantly greater Nox2 expression. Thus, Nox2 appears to be a modulator of CsA-induced hypoxia and may be a potential biomarker of CsA nephrotoxicity. Several studies show that microRNAs also participate in CsA nephrotoxicity. In particular, Yuan et al. found that mice with CsA nephrotoxicity exhibited an early increase in the miR-494 expression in the kidney. They also found that when tubular epithelial cells underwent EMT due to CsA treatment in vitro, they exhibited upregulated miR-494 expression and decreased levels of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"Nox2 modulates CsA-induced hypoxia\"\n\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"Fractional excretion of magnesium as marker (biomarker event)\"\n\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"Serum indoxyl sulfate elevated (biomarker event)\"\n\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"PTEN decreased during CsA-induced EMT in vitro\"\n\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"miR-494 increased early in kidney\"\n\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"Blocking miR-494 abrogated EMT\""}]}

To facilitate high-throughput screening of pro-inflammatory agents, we optimized culture conditions for hiMG. Our results suggest that a pre-incubation of 3 days allows for optimal cell maturation and responsiveness, as reflected in heightened sensitivity and cytokine production upon LPS exposure. This dynamic change in microglial morphology from a ramified to an amoeboid form is consistent with microglia activation and cytokine secretion in both in vivo and in vitro studies, highlighting the adaptability of microglia in response to inflammatory stimuli. Moreover, this optimized condition showcases excellent performance in HTRF-based cytokine detection assay development, specifically for IL-6 and TNFα. Beyond assessing response to LPS, our study also evaluated the responsiveness of hiMG cells to other inflammatory mediators, specifically IFN γ and IL-1 β. The observed concentration-dependent increase in both IL-6 and TNFα secretion upon IFN γ stimulation confirms that hiMG cells express the necessary receptors and possess the functional signaling pathways required to respond to this crucial cytokine, reflecting their role in orchestrating immune responses involving interferons. Similarly, the increase in IL-6 secretion following IL-1 β treatment, alongside its more limited effect on TNFα, further corroborates the functional presence of IL-1 β receptors and associated signaling cascades in hiMG, consistent with known IL-1 β biology. This broader responsiveness of hiMG cells-extending beyond simple reactivity to a single Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonist-is profoundly significant."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"LPS\",\"MIE\",\"Toll-like receptor agonist stimulation\"\n\"LPS\",\"KE\",\"Morphological activation of hiMG (ramified → amoeboid)\""}]}

A high-throughput assay using H295R human adrenocortical carcinoma cells was used to evaluate the effect of 2060 chemical samples on steroidogenesis via high-performance liquid chromatography followed by tandem mass spectrometry quantification of 10 steroid hormones, including progestagens, glucocorticoids, androgens, and estrogens. The study employed a 3 stage screening strategy. The first stage established the maximum tolerated concentration (MTC; /C21 70% viability) per sample. The second stage quantified changes in hormone levels at the MTCwhereas the third stage performed concentration-response (CR) on a subset of samples. At all stages, cells were prestimulated with 10 m Mforskolin for 48 h to induce steroidogenesis followed by chemical treatment for 48 h. Of the 2060 chemical samples evaluated, 524 samples were selected for 6-point CR screening, based in part on significantly altering at least 4 hormones at the MTC. CR screening identified 232 chemical samples with concentration-dependent effects on 17 b -estradiol and/or testosterone, with 411 chemical samples showing an effect on at least one hormone across the steroidogenesis pathway."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"forskolin\",\"KE\",\"Induces/stimulates steroidogenesis in H295R cells\""}]}

AD-114 was selected as it binds specifically to CXCR4 with low nM affinity and displayed anti-fibrotic properties in a bleomycin model of IPF. 19 In a subsequent study, we explored half-life extension strategies, including fusion of AD-114 to the intrinsically unstructured PAS polypeptide sequence comprising 600 amino acids at its C-terminus (AD-114-PAS), but the affinity of AD-114PAS for CXCR4 remained modest (low nM). 19 Therefore, as reported here, we elected to fuse AD-114 to an Fc domain to extend the half-life and increase affinity/avidity as well as manufacturability. Indeed, AD-214 binds specifically to CXCR4 with ~ 1,000-fold enhanced affinity compared to the untagged AD-114, consistent with an increased avidity due to the i-body existing as a dimer with a molecular weight of ~75 kDa. Notably, AD-214 bound to FcRn with the same affinity as that reported for other monoclonal antibodies, 20,32 demonstrating that the Fc of AD-214 retains its ability to bind to FcRn, which contributes to prolonged serum half-life of IgGs and Fc-fusion proteins. Moreover, the addition of the DAPAmutated Fc resulted in a half-life of AD-214 of 22-29 h in nonhuman primates, as compared to AD-114 which is rapidly cleared."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"AD-214\",\"KE\",\"Extended serum half-life in non-human primates\""}]}

Future work is also needed to disentangle potential cytotoxic factors driving cytokine release in response to chemical exposure, as prolonged overactivation of microglia in culture can lead to cell death. Integrating this platform within a larger toxicological framework could assist in identifying key neuroinflammatory pathways activated by various compounds, providing insights for risk assessment in public health. The application of this assay platform also extends to drug discovery and development for neurodegenerative diseases. By utilizing the hiMG model to screen potential therapeutic agents, researchers can evaluate the anti-inflammatory properties of novel compounds, potentially leading to the identification of drugs that modulate microglial responses and attenuate neuroinflammatory processes. Additionally, the platform can facilitate phenotypic drug screening, allowing for the examination of compounds that not only reduce proinflammatory cytokine secretion under stimulation but also promote microglial homeostasis and neuroprotection. Furthermore, for our broader neuroinflammation screening efforts in the future, we plan to incorporate a cell viability assay as a counter screen to accurately rule out cytotoxic compounds and distinguish true inflammatory responses from cell deathmediated signal decreases.

Applications of the individual AOPs used to derive the network have varied, between continued development and WoE assessment, through to the evaluation of published literature, and the formulation of a proof of concept for the viability of an in vitro-based risk assessment via integration of mechanistic endpoints and toxicokinetic modelling. The AOP network established in this study provides a comprehensive and advanced mechanistic representation of nephrotoxicity, detailing connections between multiple pathways and adverse effects, including kidney failure and CKD. The OECD AOP-Wiki serves as an exceptional database for curating, assessing, and authenticating linear AOPs. It not only ensures the reliability of mechanistic data, but also aids in identifying gaps in knowledge and prioritising testing techniques. By providing a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying nephrotoxicity, AOP networks can contribute to more accurate predictions of the potential hazards and risks of chemicals and ultimately improve the protection of human health and the environment.

In this study, we focused on a single TPO assay from the ToxCast data set as our end point. This choice was driven by our specific interest in TPO disruption, a biologically critical target involved in TH synthesis. It is important to note that using a single assay may not fully capture the range of molecular mechanisms or chemical structures associated with TH disruption. While ToxCast was used exclusively for training, we acknowledge that our approach is primarily informed by the chemical structures represented in the data set. In terms of broader applicability, compounds from the CompTox dashboard were used as a test set, which encompasses a more diverse range of chemical structures. As a result, the Tanimoto similarity analysis showed a mean of 0.569 across the training and test sets, indicating moderate chemical diversity. This helps ensure that the model is not simply memorizing structural patterns and can generalize effectively to new, unseen compounds. Such diversity is essential for building robust predictive models in the context of chemical toxicity. A significant obstacle in training ML models for these methods is the need for large quantities of precisely labeled data. AL provides an effective strategy. It is an iterative process where the model identifies and selects the most informative data points to be labeled, optimizing the learning process with a reduced number of labeled samples."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

By combining this viral approach with the TRAP2 mouse, we achieved combinatorial transduction of a Credependent/Flp-dependent eYFP-expressing AAV (AAV8hSyn -C /F -eYFP) in nociceptive MOR-expressing neurons. This INTRSECT approach revealed diffuse axonal projections from l/vlPAG nociceptive, MOR+ neurons, with relatively denser GFP+ fibers occurring in key ascending and descending nociceptive regions in a representative male mouse, including the medial nucleus of the central amygdala CeM, mediodorsal thalamus (MDTh), ventral tegmental area (VTA), RVM, among other regions with GFP expression ( Fig. 1c; Extended Data Fig. 1d ). These results suggest that the acutely nociceptive MOR-expressing cells in the l/vlPAG send extensive brain-wide projections that can influence the perception of pain and engagement in affectivemotivational behaviors. Figure 1. Noxious stimulation recruits transcriptionally-defined opioidergic efferent circuits arising in the ventrolateral PAG. Next, we sought to elucidate the unique genetic profiles of nociceptive PAG projection neurons relative to all PAG and dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) neurons.

In C57BL/6 mice treated with a single 20 -25 mg/kg cisplatin dose, TNFR2 deficiency significantly attenuated acute renal failure by reducing apoptosis, necrosis, and inflammation. Experimental and clinical observations have shown that multiple injections of cisplatin cause the transition to CKD. Cumulative injections of 10 mg/kg cisplatin every 7 days impacted the severity of kidney injury, causing fibrosis to develop in a mouse model. However, 6 mg/kg over 7 days or 10 mg/kg over 14 days did induce the same effects. Similarly, 20 mg/kg cisplatin led to high mortality, whereas a lower dose (10 mg/kg) resulted in a full spectrum of AKI with tubular necrosis, azotaemia, but without mortality 7 days after cisplatin injection. Collectively, the available in vitro and in vivo studies using the chemical stressors of this AOP show the effects on all KEs, with some evidence to demonstrate upstream events influencing downstream KEs at different doses and time intervals.

Rosacea is characterized by abnormal inflammatory responses to regular environmental stimuli (e.g., ultraviolet light and microbes) mediated by abnormally increased neuromediators, proteases, cytokines, vitamin D, and TLR-2 signaling. TLR-2 signaling can recruit a variety of inflammatory mediators, many of which are regulated by the transcription factor NF-kB, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) or tumor necrosis factora (TNFa ). An NF-kB binding site in the promoter region of G protein receptor kinase (GRKs) could be involved in shifting GPCR signaling. These kinases are well known to regulate GPCR cell function, including receptor internalization and desensitization, thereby leading to reduced receptor numbers (by downregulation) as well as alternate signaling via recruitment of b -arrestin. Moreover, shifts in AR signaling have been linked to the induction of inflammation by increasing NF-kB levels. This could be a possible mechanism for the adverse rebound effect observed in some patients using brimonidine. Mast cells may contribute to the inflammatory loop in rosacea as well."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Cellular toxicity, which could be induced by an excessflow of Ca 2 þ into neurons, was not detected, but rather, cell viability was enhanced by 1 m MDMeven24hafter the incubation. These results suggest that the turnover of intracellular Ca 2 þ could be accelerated in neurons stimulated with DM. Consistent with the maintenance of [Ca ], the Bdnf-pIV activity remained elevated for at least 24 h after the incubation with 1 m M DM. Since the half-life of thefirefly luciferase protein is estimated at about 3 h, it is unlikely that the increased level of Bdnf-pIV activity at 12 or 24 h is due to the luciferase synthesized immediately after the stimulation. That is, it is more likely that the Ca 2 þ signal-dependent activation of Bdnf-pIV continued even 24 h after the incubation. In support of this, addition of nicardipine or GABA reduced the DM-induced activation of Bdnf-pIV 12 h after the incubation of cortical neurons with DM, indicating that the Ca 2 þ influx via L-VDCC is continuously caused by DM. Taken together, it is evident that the strong, continuous Bdnf eIV-IX mRNA expression induced by DM is primarily caused by the continuous elevation of [Ca 2 þ ] and, thereby, the activation of Bdnf-pIV."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"nicardipine\",\"KE\",\"Inhibition of deltamethrin-induced Bdnf promoter IV activation\""}]}

Furthermore, while separation of three of the GABA antagonists is clear, separation of the other classes of compounds is not as robust, as the 95% confidence ellipses overlap for these compounds (Supplemental Fig. 5). In order for these approaches to provide useful classification of unknown chemicals, they will need to produce clear separation of different classes of known chemicals. The overlap is driven by the variability of the data, which may be influenced by several different parameters. Concentration-response curves were collected in a cumulative manner, thus issues such as intracellular accumulation of chemicals and/or receptor desensitization may contribute to variability or differences between chemicals. This variability could be decreased either by including more replicates, or preferably, by having a better understanding of and control over experimental conditions that contribute to variability.

Systems biology and advanced bioinformatics tools generate new hypotheses. They furnish new insights into and predictions of biological mechanisms induced by chemical substances, including drugs and environmental pollutants. Compelling evidence indicates that a number of chemical substances may play a causative role in diseases. Computational sciences, including systems toxicology, can speed up the identifi-cation of linkage between adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) and a chemical stressor as well as its effects on health. TheconceptofanAOPwasoriginallyproposedbyAnkleyetal. AOPs integrate various key events (KEs) to connect biological perturbations, at the molecular or cellular levels, to toxicity events [i.e., adverse outcomes (AOs)] at organismal and population levels. The use of clearly identified AOPs for decision-making is part of a global methodological initiative, which has, among its goals, the reduction of animal use in toxicity testing. AOPs are expected to be used more and more in regulatory frameworks since they provide evidence-based mechanistic insights.

With the exception of cyproconazole ( /C0 39.4% change in wMFR), all of the hits clearly altered wMFR well beyond the higher threshold in this cohort. Only three compounds (fluconazole, triazole and 17 b -estradiol) had wMFR values that fell between the threshold value for the first and second cohorts. None of the five negative compounds in the second cohort (amoxicillin, glyphosate, saccharin, salicylic acid, and sorbitol) caused changes greater than the hit threshold for either cohort. Concentration-response curves were generated for eight compounds; four of which were hits (genistein, vinclozolin, 17 b -Trenbolone, and piperonyl butoxide) and four of which were negatives (fluconazole, 1H-1,2,4-triazole, 17 b -estradiol, and macozeb) in the single point screen.

The network parameter connectedness, e.g., burst rate and mean firing rate, seen after rotenone treatment is not visible for all compounds. This might be due to parameters compensat ing each other, like penthiopyrad decreasing the number of spikes per burst and increasing the burst frequency at the same time or BMCs being close to the upper testing limit, like for β-cyfluthrin. In the last years, scientists from academia, industry, and regulatory authorities across the world agreed on the need for a standardized in vitro testing strategy, aiming for a cheaper and faster generation of additional data for DNT hazard assessment. This resulted in the compilation of a DNT IVB, which includes various test methods covering different KEs of neurodevelopment, including the formation and function of neural networks. One of the gaps identified in the DNT IVB is the assessment of network formation and function in a human-based cell model. To fill this gap, we established the human neural network formation assay (hNNF), which consists of hiPSC-derived excitatory and inhibitory neurons and primary astroglia (SynFire, NeuCyte, USA). The functionality of neuronal subtypes and the ability of the cell model to detect alterations via a known MoA were confirmed by pharmacological modulation.

Perturbations to mitochondrial function cause subsequent increases in ROS production, activates the various pathways associated with apoptotic and necrotic cell death. Pt-DNA adducts induce oxidative stress and damage by increasing intracellular levels of ROS following insult to the mitochondria. Increasing levels of ROS overwhelm the antioxidant capacity of cells to induce oxidative stress. Under oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation is promoted, causing high levels of cellular damage and cell death. Progressive inflammation in response to Pt drug-induced nephrotoxicity disturbs the surrounding cellular environment, promoting continued activation of the inflammatory responses that further exacerbates the conditions necessary to encourage further cell death. As dead cells continue to detach from the basement membrane, they are deposited, and begin to obstruct, the tubular lumen. Subsequent inflammatory responses and continued cell death induces proximal tubular damage to cause tubular necrosis. Continued amplification of kidney injury in response to the progression of tubular necrosis, combined with a sustained decline of function is known to induce kidney failure. However, it is likely that alternative factors also play a role in perpetuating kidney failure.

They show that autophagy is a very complex process and it actually remains unclear how exactly autophagy contributes to chronic CsA nephropathy. To the best of our knowledge, Pallet et al. were thefirst to report a study on this question: they found that when primary human renal tubular cells were subjected to CsA, they underwent autophagy, as indicated by the production of autophagosomes and the cellular expression of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3II (LC3II), which is a marker of autophagy. Significantly, when autophagy was inhibited, apoptosis increased. Pallet et al. also showed that CsA-induced autophagy is dependent on ER stress since salubrinal, which protects against ER stress, suppressed LC3II expression. Similarly, when rat pituitary GH3 cells were treated with CsA, it increased the expression of the autophagy markers LC3I and LC3II in a dose-dependent manner.

In accordance, Guo et al. reported that the ROS scavenger vitamin C (ascorbic acid, Asc, 150 µM) enhanced the differentiation of primary mouse NPCderived OPCs into OLs and further promoted expression of OL lineage markers O4, CNPase and MBP concentration-dependently. We also observed that ascorbic acid enhanced hNPC-derived OL maturation. However, in contrast to Guo et al., we did not observe this enhanced maturation in OLs derived from PND1 mouse neurospheres. This might be due to different developmental stages of animals as Guo et al. used cortices of E14.5 mouse embryos for NPC generation. Likewise, differentiation of hNPCs in presence of 100 µM ascorbic acid increased the percentage of O4 + oligodendrocytes within the NPC5 assay by approximately 60% ( Figure 5E )."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"ascorbic acid\",\"KE\",\"increased oligodendrocyte differentiation\""}]}

The latter agent may be a crucial mediator by which CsA induces nitration of tyrosine (antioxidant-sensitive), a marker for nitrosative stress-mediated endothelial damage. Several studies show that CsA-induced apoptosis in renal tubular cells relates to mitochondrialfission. Since one of the main sources of intracellular ROS is the mitochondria, de Arriba et al. studied the effects of CsA on the mitochondrial functions in LLC-PK1 tubular cells. First, they showed that CsA induces ROS synthesis and decreases the levels of the antioxidant glutathione. Subsequently, they found that CsA reduces the mitochondrial membrane potential ( ΔΨ m), generates mitochondrial permeability transition pores, and causes cytochrome c to be released into the intermembrane space. It is noteworthy that as well as increasing oxidative stress, CsA treatment also decreases the antioxidant capacity of the kidney. This is exemplified by the study of Ghaznavi et al.: when they treated rats with CsA, the total antioxidant capacity in the kidney tissues dropped significantly. A low antioxidant status is likely to sensitize the kidney to various stresses and thereby lead to nephrotoxicity. It is also possible that the CsA-induced dietary effect or nutritional status promote nephrotoxicity.

We have chosen four structurally different pesticides (endosulfan, an organochlorine pesticide; chlorpyrifos, an organophosphate insecticide; cypermethrin, type II pyrethroid insecticide, and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, a chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbon acid pesticide) to examine and compare their effects on DNA damage in acutely cultured human lymphocytes by the comet assay. In addition, possible differences in response between smoking and nonsmoking subjects were also investigated. Venous blood samples were obtained from healthy male nonsmoker ( n 5 7) and smoker ( n 5 8) donors. Primary cultures of lymphocytes were prepared and test groups were treated with three different concentrations (1, 5, and 10 l M) of endosulfan, chlorpyrifos, cypermehrin, and 2,4-D. DNA damage was assessed by alkaline comet assay. We determined an increase in the ratio of DNA migration in human lymphocyte cell cultures as a result of treatment with cypermethrin, 2,4-D and chlorpyrifos at high concentration. Endosulfan had no significant genotoxic effect even at 10 l M concentration. We suggest that chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin are more potentially genotoxic than endosulfan and 2,4-D.

Blunted enkephalin release resulting from noxious water stimulation to the hindpaw occurred in opposition to the immediate increase in MOR cell activation. However, the attenuating effect of acute nociception on enkephalin release was transient during protracted pain elicited by hindpaw capsaicin.

C. elegans predict chemically induced developmental toxicity in rats and rabbits nearly as well as those two mammalian species predict developmental effects in each other, supporting the model ' s utility as a component of alternative developmental toxicity test batteries and integrated testing strategies. The C. elegans genome encodes conserved genes for the biosynthesis and function of neurotransmitters acetylcholine, dopamine, and serotonin; in both nematodes and mammals, excitatory motor neurons release acetylcholine and inhibitory motor neurons release γ -aminobutyric acid (GABA). Molecules involved in neurotransmitter packaging, release, re-uptake, and postsynaptic signal cascades are also highly conserved, making the machinery of the neuromuscular junction similar between C. elegans and humans. These concordant neuronal features are the basis for C. elegans ' high positive detection rate for human neurotoxicants. Changes in developmental measures such as growth and behavior, at any stage of development, reversible or permanent, are important components of chemical safety evaluations. Growth inhibition and delayed milestone acquisition are apical effects that can reflect a variety of underlying functional deficits, and are therefore used as general endpoints that require further testing to identify causative toxic modes of action (MOA)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

As recommended by the EFSA Scientific Committee, the BMC approach was applied to derive a reference point or point of departure, whereby the BMR should be defined as an effect size that is higher than the general variability of the measured endpoint. Based on the inter-experimental standard deviation (1.5*COV), which was calculated for every parameter presented in this study (Tab. 1), we defined the BMR50 (reduction) and BMR50ind (induction) as the degree of change that, if exceeded, results in a positive response (hit). Furthermore, Crofton and colleagues state that the concentration range covered, and the resulting concentration-response, play a highly significant role in terms of comparison of sensitivity between different endpoints. For this study, we selected a concentration range that has already been used in other in vitro DNT assays and has elicited little to no cytotoxicity. To discriminate specific from unspecific effects, we assessed the cytotoxicity of each compound on a weekly level during the 35-day culture period (P7 'Endpoint selectivity'). Another crucial requirement for assay development is the selection of endpoint-specific controls, altering the endpoint by known MoA both negatively and positively. In the present study, Bis-I, a PKC inhibitor was selected as an endpoint-specific control (P8 'Endpoint-selective controls'). In primary rat cortical cells, the inhibition of PKC blocked the local astrocytic contact and thus the facilitation of excitatory synaptogenesis throughout the neuron."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Bis-I\",\"MIE\",\"Protein kinase C inhibition\""}]}

At the concentration ranges tested, all the five pyrethroids induced clear dose dependent cytotoxic effects, fenpropathrin being the most toxic. Nuclear division index (NDI) and the newly introduced index of cytotoxicity, the cytokinesis block proliferation i dex (CBPI), reflected the dose dependency more accurately than the percentage of binucleated cells did. CBPI is similar to NDI except that it estimates the average number of cell divisions that the cell population has gone through, and, therefore, classifies both trinucleate and tetranucleate cells into the same category. Cypermethrin and fenpropathrin slightly increased the number of MN and micronucleated cells in WB lymphocyte cultures from two out of the three donors. Deltamethrin produced a positive response only in WB cultures of one donor and in IL cultures of another donor. Permethrin gave mostly negative results, although it increased the MN frequency in WB cultures of one donor when 6/~g/ml Cyt-B was used. Fenvalerate did not significantly induce MN. With certain reservations to the purity and isomer composition of each pesticide, the existing information appears to support the idea that pyrethroid insecticides have a weak (cypermethrin, deltamethrin and fenpropathrin) or nule (fenvalerate and permethrin) genotoxic activity in vitro.

Gill cells represent an important site for toxicant uptake via water, whereas the gut cell has been discussed as a viable model for hydrophobic chemicals that sorb to organic matter and could enter the fish through a dietary route. The pesticides we evaluated have differing modes of toxic action and vast physicochemical properties that could affect cells differently, which could explain the more variable nature of our study versus that of Schug et al.

Importantly, AD-214 had a larger impact on fibrosis-related biomarkers in co-cultures of epithelial cells and fibroblasts than on fibroblasts cultured alone, suggesting impacts on cell-cell communication and/ or paracrine signaling. Interestingly, there is compelling evidence that the markers that were reduced by AD-214 are all involved in progressing fibrosis. Papiris et al. demonstrated that high levels of IL-6 and IL-8 correlated with acute exacerbations in early IPF and that an increase in IL-6 and IL-8 levels is associated with negative patient outcomes. 45 Additionally, we observed that AD-214 attenuated the expression of MCP-1/CCL2, another chemokine known to play a key role in the pathogenesis of IPF. 46 This is notable because of the potential for redundancy among chemokines involved in the pathogenesis of IPF and suggests that AD214 offers the unique modality of dual-chemokine pathway inhibition: direct CXCR4 blockade and inhibition of MCP1/CCL2 expression.

Although we found no quantitative differences in measuring cell cycle delay between NDI and CBPI, CBPI can be considered biologically more relevant in measuring cell cycle delay. Our results show that CBPI and NDI are more effective in measuring cell cycle progression than the percentage of BN cells which is not always reduced by toxic treatments, because a decrease in the number of multinucleated cells may not affect or may even increase the percentage of BN ceils.

The first principal component accounts for frequency of bursts-such as bursts per minute and spike rate. In the second principal component, decreasing percentage of spikes in burst and increases in spike and spike rate account for the majority of the variance (Fig. 4). In the plot of PCA barycenters, GABA receptor antagonists RDX, BIC, and LND clustered together positively in the first principal second and third principal components (Fig. 5). Although the 95% confidence ellipse for LND is not as tight as those for RDX and BIC, the 95% confidence ellipses for these compounds overlap in the first and second as well as the first and third components (Supplemental Fig. 5).

Human exposure to DEHP arises mainly from ingestion, inhalation, and dermal absorption; however, food packaged in plastic/PVC materials can also contribute to the exposure. DEHP was found in serum and urine of children, young girls, and women, in endometrial tissues and breast milk, whereas DEHP metabolites were found in follicular fluid in the nM range. One of the main targets of DEHP is the female reproductive system. Human epidemiological studies show an association between DEHP exposure and adverse reproductive outcomes in women, such as an increased risk of miscarriage, a decreased pregnancy rate in female factory workers, and endometriosis. Moreover, an association between the levels of urinary phthalate metabolites in couples involved in the in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedure shows that phthalate exposure adversely affects the IVF outcome, increases the risk of biochemical pregnancy, failed clinical pregnancy, and decreases the percentage of live births.

Therefore, understanding the common mechanisms involved in CVD, CAA, and dementia may reveal novel therapeutic targets that could refine the treatment of neuro-CVDs. Recent evidence indicates the involvement of amyloid-beta (A β ) peptides not only in the development and prognosis of AD 11-13 but also in the pathophysiology and prognosis of CVD. 14-17 Amyloid-beta is a 252 Aivalioti et al. proteolytic fragment of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) known for its involvement in AD and CAA. 18,19 Amyloid precursor protein is ubiquitously expressed in our body cells including neurons, 20 platelets, 21 cardiomyocytes, 22 and endothelial cells. 23 Amyloid-beta deposits have been found not only in brain parenchyma of patients with AD 11 but also in human atherosclerotic plaques 24 or cardiac tissues of patients with heart failure, 16 suggesting its involvement in both brain and CVD. Evidence from GWAS further supports the involvement of A β metabolism in age-related neuro-CVDs. For instance, a recent study including migraineur women has shown that the presence of rs1047964 in the beta-secretase 1 (BACE-1) gene, which expresses a secretase with a pivotal role in amyloidogenesis, 25 has been associated with increased CV death in this population."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"amyloid-beta\",\"KE\",\"Platelet release of Aβ in plaques\"\n\"amyloid-beta\",\"KE\",\"Cardiomyocyte apoptosis\""}]}

CPF in the air reacts with · OH radicals by photolysis and is converted into CPFox, with a half-life of 12 h. There are also reports that CPF can also be transformed into CPF-ox by reaction with ozone and nitrate radicals. The longer duration of CPF-ox in the air compared to CPF (3 h) may be another negative factor of its impact on the body of animals and humans. The distance that CPF or CPF-ox can cover in the air largely depends on the meteorological conditions such as wind speed, UV radiation, and air temperature. Mackay et al. indicated that CPF was detected in air samples both in regions where it was applied to crops and at locations away from the application areas (Figure 1). This may suggest that CPF migrates easily with air currents. Furthermore, research conducted in 2019 in Norway found that the compound was detected in house dust samples at levels from <3.0 to 1300 µ g/kg dw. This is of major concern because with air currents and then through rainfall, CPF may be detected in soil, water, and plants, further endangering human health.

Much evidence has recently emerged that BDNF affects dendritic structures, which are thought to be essential to synaptic plasticity. In addition, the level of BDNF expression in the brain changes in patients with neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer ' s, Parkinson ' s and Huntington ' s disease or psychiatric disorders including depression and schizophrenia. Thus, it seems highly possible that the expression of BDNF in the brain plays a fundamental role in expressing a variety of neuronal functions and its impairment induces neuronal diseases. The BDNF gene ( Bdnf ) consists of eight 5 exons (exons I w VIII) and a common 3 exon (exon IX), encoding a preproBDNF protein. Nine promoters, Bdnf promoter I w IX ( BdnfpI w pIX ), were mapped upstream of the exons, each of which is controlled differently in the brain. The Bdnf transcript containing exon IV ( Bdnf eIV-IX ) is the most abundant and widely detected in the rat brain."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"deltamethrin\",\"AO\",\"Neurotrophic effects on neurons\"\n\"deltamethrin\",\"KE\",\"Prolonged activation of Bdnf promoter IV\"\n\"deltamethrin\",\"KE\",\"Activation of Bdnf promoter IV via Ca2+-responsive elements\"\n\"deltamethrin\",\"KE\",\"Continuous Ca2+ signaling drives prolonged Bdnf promoter activation\"\n\"deltamethrin\",\"KE\",\"Sensitivity of Bdnf induction to GABAA receptor activation\""}]}

Previous studies have demonstrated that the MA-10 Leydig cell line responds to hCG by stimulating progesterone biosynthesis and that eCG exhibits both LH and FSH-like activities in nonequid species. 30 Based on this, we tested whether this mouse-derived cell line could serve as an alternative method to evaluate the biological activity of products containing eCG. For consistency, we limited our evaluation batches from source A due to their similarity with the analytical standard PMSG, used here as a positive control in our bioassays. To ensure that observed effects on progesterone production were not confounded by changes in cell viability, we first assessed the impact of products containing eCG on MA-10 cell viability. In general, treatment with commercial products and the analytical standard PMSG had minimal effects on the cell viability (Figure 3A). Notably, only batch A1 treatment demonstrated increased cell viability at concentrations of 0.01 and 10 IU/ml when compared to the vehicle control and at concentrations of 0.01; 0.1, and 100 IU/mL relative to PMSG (Figure 3A)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"batch A1\",\"KE\",\"Increased MA-10 cell viability (specific concentrations)\""}]}

Key event 3: increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) Like many nephrotoxic drugs, Pt drugs can disrupt the homeostatic balance between ROS production and antioxidant defence systems. PtDNA cross-linked adducts induce cell death via oxidative stress and damage though increased levels of free radicals, particularly ROS, which are thought to be primarily of mitochondrial origin in cisplatin induced nephrotoxicity. Increasing levels of ROS overwhelm the antioxidant capacity of cells to induce oxidative stress. Elevated ROS reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and ATP depletion because of mitochondrial dysfunction are vital mechanisms within cisplatin-induced AKI. Increased accumulation of cisplatin in PTEC exacerbates mitochondrial damage and dysfunction to stimulate ROS production. The activity of antioxidants that maintain ROS levels, such as catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were also shown to be impaired by cisplatin and oxaliplatin. Carboplatin was also shown to reduce GSH and increase oxidised GSH at high doses. Similarly, oxaliplatin was reported to induce oxidative stress in a ROS-dependent manner. Increased ROS production alters MMP and the mtETC, further intensifying intracellular ROS levels, eventually resulting in apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, while transient ERK activation promotes cell survival via Bcl-2 upregulation, sustained ERK signalling exacerbates cisplatin nephrotoxicity by enhancing NOX4-derived ROS production."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Carboplatin\",\"KE\",\"Reduced GSH and increased oxidised GSH at high doses\"\n\"Cisplatin\",\"KE\",\"Reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and ATP depletion\"\n\"Oxaliplatin\",\"KE\",\"Oxidative stress in ROS-dependent manner\"\n\"Carboplatin\",\"KE\",\"Apoptotic cell death via ROS accumulation\"\n\"Cisplatin\",\"KE\",\"Increased ROS (mitochondrial origin)\"\n\"Oxaliplatin\",\"KE\",\"Tubular necrosis severity increased with thiol depletion (reported)\"\n\"Carboplatin\",\"KE\",\"Reduced capacity to impair mitochondrial protein synthesis or increase intracellular ROS (vs cisplatin)\"\n\"Oxaliplatin\",\"KE\",\"Impaired antioxidant defenses (catalase, SOD, GPx)\"\n\"Oxaliplatin\",\"KE\",\"Decreased cell viability and increased intracellular ROS (dose-dependent)\"\n\"Cisplatin\",\"KE\",\"Impairment of antioxidant defenses (catalase, SOD, GPx)\"\n\"Carboplatin\",\"KE\",\"Oxidative stress (decreased GSH/GSSG ratio)\""}]}

Increased expression of SPP1 has been linked to several bone-related diseases such as osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteosarcoma. While the biological functions of ACP5 and SPP1 in bone metabolism have been relatively well-studied, the roles of CLEC5A and DKK3 in bone-related processes remain less understood. CLEC5A has been established as a positive regulator of osteoclastogenesis in mouse. Furthermore, in a mouse experiment, the activation of CLEC5A enhanced the recruitment of inflammatory cytokines to the joints and promoted bone erosion, indicating its role in immune-mediated skeletal disorders. The DKK family has been shown to inhibit the Wnt/ β -catenin signaling pathway, which is a key regulator of bone remodeling. Specifically, DKK1, the most extensively studied subtype expressed by mature osteoblasts and osteocytes, has been associated with low bone mineral density in adolescent patients and with fresh hip fractures in the elderly in a case-control study. Our findings of the positive associations of PFAS with these proteins produced by bone tissues, including ACP5, SPP1, CLEC5A, and DKK3, provide insights into the potential mechanistic osteotoxicity of PFAS.

Two MIEs, namely 'AHR activation' and 'Deposition of energy', are connected to apoptosis in the HFRT-AOP network. While 'Deposition of energy' is referred to ionization in the AOP-Wiki and most likely does not represent an MIE, 'AHR activation' could be an initial event leading to DEHPinduced apoptosis. It has been shown that DEHP and its major metabolite MEHP can increase mRNA expression of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) in granulosa cells. However, a search of the CompTox database did not reveal the interaction of DEHP with any of the in vitro AHR assays. Possible indirect evidence for the connection between DEHP and AHR could represent the detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress in DEHP-exposed cultured newborn mouse ovaries, cumulus cells of large animals, murine ovarian antral follicles, and rat granulosa cells. In the HFRT-AOP network, activation of the AHR is only connected with increases in pro-apoptotic protein expression. Being experimentally associated with DNA strand breaks in DEHP-exposed ovaries, oxidative stress can connect AHR with increase in DNA strand breaks. Increases in pro-apoptotic protein expression and increase in DNA strand breaks will lead to apoptosis, which will further cause a decrease in ovarian follicle pool and oogenesis and finally impaired fertility."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"DEHP\",\"KE\",\"Increase in DNA strand breaks\"\n\"DEHP\",\"KE\",\"Ovarian follicle pool reduced\"\n\"DEHP\",\"KE\",\"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) / oxidative stress detected\"\n\"DEHP\",\"KE\",\"Decreased oogenesis\"\n\"DEHP\",\"KE\",\"Increased pro-apoptotic protein expression\"\n\"MEHP\",\"KE\",\"Increased AHR mRNA expression\""}]}

This resulted in total system scalar perturbation over time trajectories that were visualized for each replicate and summarized by localized regression curves (Fig. 3). For example, the total scalar perturbation of acetaminophen remained below the shaded uncertainty range of 3× the median absolute deviation (MAD) of untreated control wells across all timepoints (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the scalar perturbation of haloperidol exposure increased with increasing haloperidol concentration and extended well past the 3× MAD limit (Fig. 3B)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Acetaminophen\",\"KE\",\"No meaningful scalar perturbation across development\"\n\"Haloperidol\",\"KE\",\"Perturbation of normal network development with partial recovery at intermediate concentrations\"\n\"Acetaminophen\",\"KE\",\"No appreciable impact on network activity\""}]}

Since its establishment in 2010, the concept of the AOP has gained significant attention within chemical risk assessment communities. As such, it presents a valuable means towards the advancement of in silico tools such as quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) and innovative in vitro toxicity screening tests. AOPs comprise a series of causal connections across varying levels of the biological organisation-originating from a molecular perturbation triggered by a stressor, known as the molecular initiating event (MIE), and proceeding through a sequence of intermediate key events (KE), before culminating in the adverse outcome (AO). These KEs are interconnected by key event relationships (KERs), which represent the causal link between perturbation in one and emergence of another."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

How endogenous opioids are regulated or released in the PAG during chronic pain is relatively unexplored. One clear example of this, however, occurs with Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA)induced inflammatory pain. Across the progression of inflammation, mice treated with CFA demonstrate allodynia and thermal hypersensitivity that improves after the first week. By the third week post-injury, MORs in the spinal cord undergo plasticity that renders the receptors constitutively active such that CFA-treated mice display uninjured-like mechanical sensitivity that can be reverted to the injured state with naloxone administration; this phenomenon has been termed latent sensitization. This switch in MOR function involves endogenous opioid upregulation. For these reasons, CFA-induced inflammatory pain is a tractable model for recording changes in vlPAG MOR-expressing cell activity and enkephalin tone at long time scales. Here, we performed fiber photometry recordings with either mMORp -GCaMP6f pre-CFA, and at timepoints 3, and 21days post-CFA intraplantar administration to both hindpaws, followed by naltrexone challenge on day 24, or δ Light prior to CFA administration and 21 days post-CFA ( Fig. 3k, left ). When measured at 3 weeks after CFA treatment, GCaMP6f-expressing mice (n=13, 6 males and 7 females) displayed significantly larger paw thickness and width than untreated, age-matched mice (n=7, 4 males and 3 females).

The first drugs for IPF were approved in the US in 2014 but have limited effect: they slow (but do not halt) progression, confer approximately an additional year of life expectancy, and have serious side effects resulting in 30-50% of patients discontinuing therapy within a year. 2 Although drugs for IPF have been evaluated in over 50 Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials in the past 10 years, no new therapeutic agents have been approved since 2014. Thus, there is an unmet need for more effective therapies for IPF.

Though the Hershberger assay and other in vivo tests that measure effects of test chemical on androgen responsive endpoints account for a more complete set of responses occurring in situ (e.g. effects of hepatic metabolism on parent chemical activity), results may be difficult to interpret due to the interaction of other targets and organ systems and a variety of compensatory mechanisms. Hence, results of the subset of multiple in vitro assays may better predict the effects of chemicals specifically on the AR pathway, and may provide high confidence in both the 'true' positives acting through the steroid receptor and the 'true' negatives due to the integration of multiple in vitro assays that account for different points in the signaling pathway using variable technologies.

The effect of brimonidine on other receptors or cell types might be concentration dependent, and a spillover effect after saturation of the a -AR on vascular smooth muscle could occur. Increased local concentrations ('spillover effect') may allow brimonidine to act on at least one endothelial receptor ( a -AR and other subtypes), thereby promoting NO-mediated vasodilation. Brimonidine may also act on presynaptic ARs of nerve terminals leading to reduced vasoconstriction ( a -and a -mediated). Both effects could promote local vasodilation ( a -mediated) and worsen erythema. a -ARs expressed on presynaptic nerves modulate an intense, acute release of NE that is evoked by high-frequency neuronal stimulation occurring with stress responses. In contrast, a -ARs on presynaptic nerve terminals regulate the basal, long-term release of NE due to low-frequency stimulation. Thus, these receptors tightly regulate neurotransmitter release from adrenergic nerves under basal and stressful conditions through their inhibitory presynaptic feedback loop. Taken together, differences in sympathetic nerve firing rates, and thus local NE concentrations, could impact brimonidine efficacy by competing for a -AR binding. Neuronal activation could also lead to release of other neuromediators that induce vasodilation. For example, axon-reflex vasodilation mediated by a -ARs is partially mediated by prostaglandins (which have been shown to be increased in rosacea skin) and the overall activity has been suggested to contribute to local vascular disturbances in acute or chronic inflammation."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"brimonidine\",\"KE\",\"Reduced vasoconstriction via presynaptic AR effects\"\n\"brimonidine\",\"KE\",\"Receptor saturation / spillover to other receptor subtypes or cell types\"\n\"brimonidine\",\"KE\",\"Reduced norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerve terminals\"\n\"brimonidine\",\"KE\",\"Endothelium-dependent NO-mediated vasodilation\"\n\"brimonidine\",\"KE\",\"Immune-cell activation leading to vasodilatory mediator release\""}]}

Similarly, oligodendrocytes contribute to cognition by modulating conduction velocity through myelination, affecting spike timing, oscillatory activity and synchrony in neuronal networks. Given the role of α7 nAChRs in regulating neuroinflammatory pathways, targeting α7 receptors in glial cells may influence cognitive function not only through neuronal effects but also by modulating glial responses. These mechanisms highlight how α7 targeted therapies could have broader implications for cognitive improvement in AD and schizophrenia by affecting both neuronal and non neuronal cell populations. 4 | The Role of the α7 Nicotinic Receptor in Alzheimer's Disease AD is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, memory impairment and synaptic dysfunction and is the leading cause of dementia in older adults, with significant impacts on patients, families and economic burden. The α7 nAChR has received significant attention in AD research due to its role in disease pathogenesis. Found on neurons and glial cells, these receptors are involved in neuroprotective signalling pathways and may contribute to neuroprotection in AD and their activation can release neurotrophic factors such as brain derived neurotrophic factor, which supports neuronal survival and plasticity."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

These receptors, composed of five subunits, form a central ion channel that opens upon acetylcholine binding, allowing ion flow and membrane depolarization. nAChRs are classified into three groups based on their subunit composition: 1. muscle type subunits (α1, β1, δ, ε, γ), 2. heteromeric neuronal αβ subunits (α2 α6, α10, β2 β4), and 3. homomeric neuronal subunits (α7 α9). Among neuronal nAChRs, the most widely expressed subtypes in the CNS are heteromeric α4β2 receptors and homomeric α7 receptors, while α3β4 is the dominant subtype in the PNS. These receptors vary in subunit stoichiometry, leading to different functional and pharmacological properties. For instance, The α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 nAChR) plays a crucial role in brain functions related to memory and thinking. This review looks at how drugs designed to stimulate these receptors may help treat cognitive issues in Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. Over the years, many drugs have been developed and tested in clinical trials, but most have failed to show lasting improvements in memory or thinking skills. The review discusses possible reasons for these failures and explores new strategies, such as better trial designs and combination therapies, which could improve future treatments targeting these receptors."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

On the other hand G2: M-arrest of the tested pyrethroids is in good agreement with their cytotoxic activity as shown by CFA. Although cell synchronisation in combination with flow cytometry offers a reliable method for the detection of substances with mitotic arresting activity with advantages as selective treatment of cells in G2: M phase of the cell cycle and higher sensitivity as compared to asynchroneous growing cell culture systems, the only disadvantage is that flow cytometry cannot distinguish between cells in the G2 or M-phase, that means between premitotic and mitotic cells. This differentiation is only possible by analyzing cells under the light microscope. Therefore, mitotic arresting activity was evaluated by the mitotic index (Fig. 3). With the exception of fenvalerate all tested pyrethroids led to a dose-dependent increase of the mitotic index indicating inhibition of mitosis. From these results it can be concluded that pyrethroids inhibit cell cycle progression during mitosis by interfering with the mitotic spindle apparatus.

CsA also upregulated the type I and II TGFβ 1 receptors by autocrine mechanisms. In addition, CsA induced plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 andfibronectin expression, and antibodies to TGFβ 1 blocked this expression. Organ-transplant recipients are prone to the development of multiple aggressive and metastatic non-melanoma skin cancers. When nude mice bearing human squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) xenograft tumors are treated with CsA, the skin cancers become invasive and aggressive tumors. This change associated with increased tumor TGFβ 1 expression and elevated EMT. Thus, CsA activated the TGFβ 1 signaling pathway, which enhanced the expression of proteins that promote the EMT. In addition, Chen et al. showed that by activating the TGFβ 1/Smad3 signaling pathway, CsA promotes the proliferation and migration of rat gingivalfibroblasts and their production of collagen. This helps explain why CsA treatment induces gingival overgrowth. Interestingly, CsA can also inhibit TGFβ 1 expression. Lungfibrosis is a fatal condition that is characterized by excessive extracellular matrix deposition that associates with increased TGFβ 1 activity.

However, CsA nephrotoxicity is a serious side effect that limits the clinical use of CsA. While the mechanisms underlying CsA nephrotoxicity are still not fully understood, increasing lines of evidence suggest that oxidative stress plays an important role in this phenomenon. Specifically, CsA induces endoplasmic reticulum stress and increases mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production: this modifies the redox balance, which causes lipid peroxidation and thereby induces nephrotoxicity. Recent studies on the pathogenesis of CsA nephrotoxicity suggest that CsA-induced autophagy can alleviate the deleterious effects of CsA-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress, thereby preventing nephrotoxicant-induced renal injury. A variety of signaling pathways participate in the pathogenesis of CsA nephrotoxicity. Specifically, the p38, ERK, and JNK MAPK subfamilies are all involved in CsA nephrotoxicity, while NFκ B is a target molecule of CsA. Moreover, thefibrogenic cytokine TGFβ 1 contributes to CsA-induced renalfibrosis, while Nrf2 modulates CsA-induced cellular oxidative stress. In addition, CsA generally inhibits nitric oxide synthesis and impairs endothelium-dependent relaxation in the renal artery. However, some reports also suggest that nitric oxide synthesis is enhanced in the kidney cortex during CsA nephrotoxicity. Notably, the biomarkers of CsA nephrotoxicity associated with CsA have not been reviewed previously. Therefore, in this review, we willfirst provide an update on CsA nephrotoxicity in humans and describe the potential biomarkers of CsA nephrotoxicity."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Cyclosporine A (CsA)\",\"KE\",\"Impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation\"\n\"Cyclosporine A (CsA)\",\"MIE\",\"Inhibits nitric oxide synthesis\"\n\"Cyclosporine A (CsA)\",\"KE\",\"Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) increased\"\n\"Cyclosporine A (CsA)\",\"AO\",\"Renal fibrosis\"\n\"Cyclosporine A (CsA)\",\"KE\",\"Mitochondrial membrane potential reduced\"\n\"Cyclosporine A (CsA)\",\"KE\",\"Redox balance modified\"\n\"Cyclosporine A (CsA)\",\"KE\",\"Plasma nitric oxide increased\"\n\"Cyclosporine A (CsA)\",\"KE\",\"MAPK involvement (p38/ERK/JNK)\""}]}

Mifepristone was selected because it was the most potent AR antagonist in the new set of 14 assays tested. Chemicals more potent than Mifepristone can have AUC values greater than 1. The original antagonist mode model used an 'antagonist confidence score' (CS) in addition to the AUC value (see Kleinstreuer et al., for details. The CS accounted for factors beyond what is provided by the AUC value itself, including cytotoxicity, which can confound loss-of-signal antagonist assays, and the expected antagonist potency shift, described above. Here, we have slightly modified the calculation of the CS to add additional penalties for activity at concentrations well above where cytotoxicity is observed; to penalize chemicals for which one of the nonantagonist mode AUC values is greater than the antagonist mode AUC; and, to penalize chemicals that are active in multiple cell-based assays but in none of the cell-free assays (A1-A3).

Within the hNNF assay, Bis-I reliably reduced network parameters, e.g., burst duration, network burst percentage, and network synchronicity (AUNCC). Due to the enhanced variability of the mean firing rate, no significant effect of Bis-I was observed over all conducted experimental runs. Nevertheless, Bis-I is an appropriate endpoint-specific control for assessing neural network activity in vitro. As a negative control compound, acetaminophen showed no effect on network activity. A plethora of studies confirmed the use of acetaminophen as an apt negative control for DNT in vitro testing. Nevertheless, a recently published study by Martin and colleagues categorized acetaminophen as an unfavorable negative control for DNT assays. This classification was made based on both clinical and preclinical reports, which indicate potential effects on the developing brain. Furthermore, the authors propose the use of low concentrations of acetaminophen (≤ 100 µM) in recent DNT studies as a possible reason for the absence of compound-dependent effects. In comparison, chemicals like L-ascorbic acid, dinotefuran, and metformin were listed as 'favorable' and should be included in a compound set for later determination of the assay's general performance. Following the recommendations of Crofton and colleagues, a training set of chemicals should be designed and assayed (P9 'Training set chemicals') after demonstrating that the test method has the aforementioned characteristics."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Together, diclofenac treatment induced expression of inflammatory cytokines including IFNγ, interleukins and TNFα. KE6: inflammation Our computational studies defined key master regulatory molecules and their associated networks. Based on independent RT-qPCR studies, induced expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling ( Socs ), leptin, growth hormone receptor ( Ghr ), and Ptpn proteins was confirmed and these function in IFNγ, Jak/Stat, proand anti-inflammatory signaling pathways. Stat3 is one of the major transcription factors activated by cytokines and growth factors to influence pro-inflammatory ( Mapk, p38, Jnk, and IκB kinase) and anti-inflammatory signaling (Pi3kAkt) events. Among individual animals marked induction of this protein was observed which controls transcription of Socs and inhibits Jak/Stat3 signaling. In addition, leptin and other adipokine signaling molecules play a major role in energy intake to influence monocyte and macrophage activity during inflammation. Next to its role in the control of energy intake leptin and  its receptor modulates Jak/Stat, Erk 1/2 and Pi3k signaling and therefore plays a decisive role in inflammation. Similarly, the growth hormone receptor is influenced by multiple intracellular signaling cascades (Jak-Stat and chemokine signaling) and functions in liver regeneration.

Specifically, some studies show that CsA-induced autophagy appears to attenuate CsA nephrotoxicity, while others suggest that it promotes CsA nephrotoxicity. The factors that drive one or the other function of CsA-induced autophagy and thus cause cell death or survival remain unclear. It is possible that the duration of CsA treatment plays an important role in this active balance. Additional mechanistic studies of the role of autophagy in CsA nephrotoxicity are needed. Many signaling pathways are involved in the molecular mechanisms that underlie CsA nephrotoxicity. Identifying the signaling pathways that contribute to CsA nephrotoxicity is of great importance because this information could lead to the development of early biomarkers of kidney injury. The ERK1/2 pathway plays an important role in the activation of ROS and oxidative stress, and it promotes CsA-induced glomerular dysfunction and the subsequent nephrotoxicity. Crosstalk between p38/ERK and Smad differentially regulates apoptosis in CsAinduced renal proximal tubular cell injury. NFκ B is an important target of CsA and the ability of the anti-aging protein Klotho to ameliorate CsA nephrotoxicity is mediated by its downregulation of this transcription factor.

These results suggest a clear and substantial enkephalinergic innervation of vlPAG that may arise from within vlPAG itself, but likely includes multiple sources such as the central amygdala and parabrachial nucleus, among others ( Extended Data Fig. 9e-f ). Existing attempts to measure enkephalin peptide levels directly in PAG have relied on the slow-timescale modality of microdialysis that collects samples on the order of tens of minutes. These types of measurements occlude sub-minute and sub-second alterations in enkephalin release dynamics that likely occur. Therefore, we employed a newly developed fluorescence-based enkephalin biosensor called δ Light. This sensor can be targeted to cell types of interest, such as MOR+ cells with mMORp AAVs, and enables post-synaptic detection of enkephalin release and synaptic enkephalin tone in real-time, as binding of enkephalin peptide to the sensor combined with blue light excitation elicits green fluorescence that can be detected with standard fiber photometry equipment ( Fig. 3d; Extended Data 10a-c ). We first sought to demonstrate the ability of δ Light expressed in vlPAG to detect and report agonist binding in vivo in awake, behaving mice using the exogenous δ opioid receptor agonist SNC 162. Across treatment conditions (n=16 mice, 11 males and 5 females), δ Light produced fluorescence increases that scaled with dose of SNC 162 administered ( Fig. 3e )."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"SNC 162\",\"MIE\",\"δ opioid receptor agonism\"\n\"SNC 162\",\"KE\",\"Dose-scaled increase in δLight fluorescence\""}]}

This model assumes 100% bioavailability. The result used was the average plasma concentration (C avg ). For some chemicals the PBPK model failed because the relevant experimental parameters were not available, so the analytical concentration at steady state (C ss ) was substituted. Hershberger LOEL values were converted to plasma concentrations by multiplying by C avg. Cavg and C ss are highly correlated with C avg being larger on average by a factor of 1.4. Of the 13 false negatives, 8 had predicted internal concentrations extrapolated from the in vivo LOEL range that were above the upper limit of in vitro testing. The remaining 5 of the 13 false negatives are as follows. Two chemicals have potentially ambiguous in vivo results with 2 positive studies and one negative apiece (Permethrin and Cyfluthrin). Another two have a single Hershberger study that was positive and were called positive due to a positive result in a related study type (Propargite and Ethoprop).

To address this nondifferentiability issue, a solution is provided through the application of the policy gradient reinforcement learning algorithm. The objective function is shown as follows: where R ð s; a Þ represents the expected reward for taking action a starting from the state s. The expected reward score is a trade-off among the Wasserstein distance of the discriminator ( D ð Y Þ ), the target chemical property of pIC (O( Y Þ ) and the penalty score for mode collapse ( P ( Y )). The calculation is as follows: where l controls the trade-off among the three rewards. O( Y Þ denotes the pIC score of Y, and P ( Y ) represents the penalty for generating duplicate SMILES strings of Y. This penalty is calculated as the ratio of the number of SMILES strings to the product of the total number of SMILES strings and the number of duplicate strings. All the rewards range from 0 to 1.

In vivo synchronous bursting is associated with important nervous system processes including attention, learning, and memory. In vitro, such activity can be observed in networks of developing neurons using microelectrode array (MEA) recording techniques. MEAs measure extracellular electrical activity associated with the generation and propagation of action potentials (spikes). Over time, patterned activity in the form of groups of spikes (bursts) from the same neuron, as well as coordinated bursting of multiple neurons across a network are readily observed. Measuring chemical effects on the development of spontaneous network activity has been proposed as a screening assay for DNT, and our laboratory recently demonstrated that by using multi-well MEAs (mwMEAs) a medium-throughput assay is feasible. Our laboratory recently reported results using this medium-throughput mwMEA-based DNT assay for 86 compounds, demonstrating that 49 of 60 (82%) compounds with evidence of developmental neurotoxicity in the published literature altered development of at least one network parameter. These data also were used to develop estimates of potency (effective concentration that caused a 50% change; EC value) for those compounds that altered network development (64/86).

EDCs have been associated with adverse reproductive and developmental effects as well as increased risk of hormone-dependent cancers. Most EDC research has largely focused on chemical interaction with hormone nuclear receptors, mainly estrogen and androgen receptors, and cellular signaling pathways for these receptors. For example, the ToxCast high-throughput screening program includes 18 unique assays that evaluate chemical interactions across the estrogen signaling pathway focusing on estrogen receptor binding and activation as well as downstream effects on cell proliferation.

This latter suggestion looks pretty plausible as different research groups have already shown that some of CBZ its metabolites, AI, acridone (AO) and 9-acridine carboxaldehyde (9ACA), are more toxic than CBZ itself. AI, a transformation product (TP) of CBZ generated by electrochemistry, appeared to be the most toxic product in the Zebrafish Embryo Acute Toxicity Test (zFET), and was also found to be more toxic than CBZ.

The present studies were designed to test subsets of compounds from the ToxCast phase I and II inventories in primary cultures of cortical neuronal networks grown on mwMEAs. The compounds tested were selected based on their activity (or lack thereof) in NVS\\_IC ion channel assays in ToxCast, or their known neurotoxicity in vivo. This allowed for the testing of two separate but related hypotheses: (1) compounds testing positive in NVS\\_IC ion channel assays will alter network mean firing rate; and (2) compounds that alter firing rate will be neuroactive or neurotoxic in vivo.

In summary, primary neuronal cultures grown in mwMEAs have been characterized for screening chemicals for functional effects on the nervous system. The present results identified detection of nicotinic compounds by the MEA assay and detection of pyrethroids by NVS\\_IC assays in ToxCast as ''blindspots'' in compound space covered by these assays. Such information can be used to improve both the MEA and NVS\\_IC assays in ToxCast. This might be accomplished by modifying NVS\\_IC\\_rNACH\\_site2 assay to better detect the pyrethroids, while detection of nicotinic compounds in the MEA assay may be improved by considering endpoints in addition to wMFR, or by utilizing different brain regions (e.g. hippocampus) or culture conditions.

Together with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA), the National Toxicology Program has recommended to include, among others, in silico approaches in future assessments of toxicity as an inexpensive and efficient tool for screening purposes. Recently, the concept of new approach methodologies has been put forward; it refers to nonanimal technologies that can be used to provide information on chemical hazard and risk assessment. To carry out these assessments, the OECD has proposed 2 frameworks. The first 1 is a sciencebased approach, the Integrated Approaches to Testing and Assessment (IATA) that combines various types of existing and new data ( in vitro, in vivo, and computational) to study a specific question.

The neural induction of hiPSCs towards functional neuronal cultures comes with many advantages, especially with regard to disease modelling, but bears the issue of high variability between batches and cell lines. This variability is mostly due to the fact that every neural network differentiates into a variable number of neuronal subtypes. In addition, the generation of sufficiently active networks takes weeks to months. The use of commercially available hiPSC-derived neurons with quality and cell ratio-controlled, reproducible cells provided in large quantities circumvents these problems. In this study we present the establishment of a human neural network formation (hNNF) assay based on a commercially available kit, which consists of hiPSC-derived excitatory and inhibitory neurons and primary astroglia (SynFire, NeuCyte, USA). Pharmacological modulation confirmed the functionality of both neuronal subtypes, and chronic treatment over 35 days revealed the ability of the cell model to detect alterations by bisindolylmaleimide I (Bis-I) via a known mode of action (MoA). The assay was challenged with a test set of 28 substances and displayed compound-specific effects on network development. In the present study, 28 substances with different concerns regarding their DNT potential were tested. The compounds are part of a training set used for the current DNT in vitro battery.

Such disease-specific KEs should be interconnected, either with generic or with other disease-specific KEs, to form a more comprehensive AOP network. AOP networks are particularly important for addressing exposures to multiple stressors that lead to the same AO or else to individual stressors that perturb multiple MIEs. As such, they may aid in the understanding of potential interactions between co-occurring AOPs. By describing the components of an AOP (KEs and KERs) in a modular fashion, AOP networks can be constructed from individual pathways that share KEs-whereby KEs are represented as nodes and KERs as directed edges acting to link them. The tools of network science can utilise this modular format to quantitatively analyse AOP networks and identify KEs of interest. For the modelling and prediction of nephrotoxicity, AOP networks can identify and integrate existing knowledge about the key biological events and pathways underlying kidney damage and translate this knowledge into practical applications for toxicology and risk assessment. In this study, we used an approach previously applied in AOP networks for neurotoxicity and hepatotoxicity -following established guidelines for AOP network derivation, characterisation and analysis -to identify relevant KEs that could be used to inform the establishment of a battery of in vitro and/or in silico assays for the prediction of nephrotoxicity.

Although other differences may also exist, one clear difference is the overall efficacy of PTX to increase firing rate, which was much lower ( /C24 120% of control) than for BIC, LND and RDX ( /C24 250-400% of control). Fipronil, which also binds to and inhibits mammalian GABA receptors, decreased firing rate, bursting rate, and synchrony. The results with fipronil are consistent with previous results wherein it decreased weighted MFR in a single concentration screen. This lack of excitatory action of fipronil appears to be inconsistent with the other GABA antagonists. However, fipronil binding to vertebrate GABA receptors is several orders of magnitude lower than for insect receptors, and metabolites of fipronil have higher affinities for binding to and inhibiting the receptor than does the parent compound. Furthermore, in vivo studies indicate that fipronil toxicity in vertebrates is not well correlated with inhibition of specific binding of the GABA antagonist ethynylbicycloorthobenzoate (EBOB), even at seizureinducing doses. Fipronil is a noncompetitive antagonist of EBOB binding and does not share a common site with picrotoxinin.

Future Directions of Phthalate Research The analysis of the available literature indicates some inconsistency or deficit of the available knowledge concerning the particular aspects of phthalates' action on reproduction. For example, there is contradicting information concerning the association between phthalate exposure and pubertal onset in both girls and boys. The available publications report that phthalates can either delay or induce precocious puberty onset. The other example could be a deficit of information about cancer occurrence in phthalate-exposed men. There are only indirect indications of phthalate influence on cancer onset in humans: a higher risk of cancer occurrence was observed in male newborns with cryptorchidism and occupationally exposed humans working in the plastics industry. Therefore, it is vital to conduct more epidemiological and experimental studies to understand whether and how phthalates can induce the cancer of male reproductive organs. The expansion of the current knowledge concerning expression and intracellular mechanisms of phthalates' e GLYPH<11> ects on the male and female HPG system is necessary for the e GLYPH<14> cient prevention and treatment of their adverse influences on human and animal reproduction.

Furthermore, the TGFβ 1/interleukin (IL)-2/cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 crosstalk pathway participates in CsA-induced renal tubular atrophy and interstitialfibrosis. Moreover, CsA treatment of renal proximal tubular epithelial cells strongly activates the Nrf-2 pathway, and this activity modulates the cellular oxidative stress caused by CsA. Nitric oxide (NO) is a vasoactive factor that plays a key role in maintaining vascular tone in the kidney and several studies suggest that it also participates in CsA nephropathy. First, Rafiee et al. found that CsA inhibits NO synthesis, including in the kidney. Later, Shihab et al. found that in chronic CsA nephrotoxicity, the renal expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors is upregulated and that this effect is due to CsA-mediated suppression of NO synthesis. However, other studies show that the NO pathway is an important regulatory mechanism that protects against CsA-associated vasoconstriction. Thus, there are many unanswered questions regarding the role of the NO pathway in CsA nephrotoxicity. In 2004, the CsA nephrotoxicity and its potential strategies for the prevention of nephrotoxicity were briefly dicussed by Busauschina et al.

Thus, they can be synthesized via cross-coupling reactions and other techniques.

Based on these text mining-based results and the ones from the systems biology analysis, we decided to further explore thyroid cancer, as this outcome was the most significant 1 identified by ORA. Therefore in a second literature-based step, associations between the stressor BPF, the biological events identified previously (cell proliferation and thyroid cancer), and the proteins found by ORA (CCND1; CDH1; MAPK1; MYC; NCOA4; PPARG; RXRG) (Table 1) were explored by manual curation of available scientific publications using the PubMed database. This targeted analysis of the literature allowed to identify 9 publications (Supplementary Table 6) that were read by scientific experts to characterize a putative individual AOP (Figure 4).

CsA is used to treat SDNS and SRNS and there is controversy about whether it causes nephrotoxity in these patients. This largely reflects the fact that most of these studies involved limited patient numbers and had a retrospective design, or even lacked a control group. The precis of relevant literature of CsA nephrotoxicity in humans are summarized in Table 1. The recent advances in genomics, proteomics, and molecular pathology have led to the identification of many biomarkers that may be of clinical value. It is of considerable interest to identify biomarkers of CsA nephrotoxicity (especially those in the urine and blood) because they could greatly aid the early detection of this disease. This is important because detecting acute and chronic CsA nephrotoxicity at an early stage will help minimize kidney injury, which can become irreversible if the CsA therapy is not halted or reduced in a timely fashion. A number of biomarkers in the urine that could be used to rapidly detect CsA nephrotoxicity have been identified. Camara et al. showed that urinary RBP levels accurately predict progressive CsA nephrotoxicity in heart-transplant patients.

These MIEs are connected to a sequence of KEs linked together by KE relationships (KERs), which lead to an adverse outcome (AO). Such AOP frameworks provide a scheme describing mechanistic knowledge from existing tests. They are particularly relevant for putative endocrine disruptors (defined by their MoA). To successfully incorporate AOPs into risk assessment multiple interacting pathways or networks of AOPs should be accounted for. Individual AOP could be considered as a linear description of biological events, and can be merged via their shared events (MIE or KE). Consequently, AOP networks can be constructed by connecting 2 or more individual AOPs, if they have at least 1 common KE or KER, to provide a better description of the biological complexity with considerable additional value for emerging toxicological knowledge. Adverse outcome pathway networks can be initiated by 1 or more stressors that can be environmental chemicals.

DIV 35 staining (Fig. 2A) showed a strong presence of MAP2-positive neurons and a lower amount of NeuN ( RBFOX3 ), indicating a high maturation level of the networks. The glial marker GFAP was strongly expressed, and the co-cultures were positive for the pre-synaptic marker synapsin, the vesicular GABA transporter vGAT, and the vesicular glutamate transporter vGLUT. These characteristics were confirmed by RNA sequencing of co-cultures at different time points (Fig. 2B). The maturation of neurons within the system was verified by a high expression of neuronal maturation markers, e.g., MAP2, DLG4, and SYP, compared to genes coding for immature neurons, e.g., NEUROD1. Additionally, the high expression of GFAP and AQP4, compared to S100B, characterizes the mature glial system. Also, genes coding for GABA and AMPA receptors and glutamate transporters showed expression at DIV 7 with gradations within their subtypes (e.g., SLC1A2 vs. SLC1A3 ).

We describe here a strategy that integrates a new tool called AOP-helpFinder version 1.0, downloadable on github (https://github.com/jecarvaill/aop-helpFinder). Using the available literature, AOP-helpFinder can automaticallyfind, extract, and score links between chemical substances (i.e., stressors) and diverse biological elements, i.e., molecular initiating events (MIEs), KEs, and AOs, which are the components of AOPs. The novelty of AOP-helpFinder is that it consists of a hybrid approach that combines TM and graph theory to explore the contents of abstracts for the identification of reliable associations between a chemical and AOPs. The main objective of AOP-helpFinder is to assist toxicologists and biologists in the identification of relevant associations between AOP components and small molecules through the analysis of large-scale, existing (published in peer-review journals and databases), text-based knowledge ( in vitro, in vivo, and in silico data).

Taking that PPARG could be the MIE, this first path of DEHP-mediated effect on human female reproductive system starts with activation of PPARG, which reduces the aromatase expression/activity leading to the reduction in E2 production in the ovary and serum levels, which can further cause irregularities of the ovarian cycle either directly or indirectly through the hypothalamus-pituitary axis leading to reduced ovulation. Both the indirect and the direct path converge to the terminal AO 'Impaired fertility'. Since this path encompasses the KE 'Reduced ovulation' and the AO 'Irregularities in ovarian cycle', it is more relevant for the DEHP-mediated effect on mature females.

R. Padi, Rachel J. Godek, Wolfgang Peti & Rebecca Page Phosphoprotein phosphatases (PPPs) achieve specificity by binding substrates and regulators using PPP-specific short motifs. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a highly conserved phosphatase that regulates cell signaling and is a tumor suppressor. Here, we use cryo-electron microscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to investigate the mechanisms of human p107 substrate and Eya3 regulator recruitment to the PP2A:B55 holoenzyme. We show that, while they associate with B55 using a common set of interaction pockets, the mechanism of substrate and regulator binding differs and is distinct from that observed for PP2A:B56 and other PPPs. We also identify the core B55 recruitment motif in Eya3 proteins, a sequence conserved amongst the Eya family. Lastly, using NMR-based dephosphorylation assays, we demonstrate how B55 recruitment directs PP2A:B55 fidelity through the selective dephosphorylation of specific phosphosites. As PP2A:B55 orchestrates mitosis and DNA damage repair, these data provide a roadmap for pursuing new avenues to therapeutically target this complex by individually blocking a subset of regulators that use different B55 interaction sites. Serine/threonine phosphorylation-dependent signaling is essential for the control of most biological processes 1.

The stimulation of neuropeptide release by innate immune receptors, such as TLR2 and PAR2, may be critically involved in inflammatory vasodilation, as observed in all three skin subtypes of rosacea. COX-2 and prostaglandin production, both of which are elevated in rosacea, may increase a -receptor-mediated NO, thereby contributing to vasodilation and edema via a prostanoid-dependent pathway. Furthermore, the effects of brimonidine treatment may be different in the early versus late inflammation, as immune and vascular responses can shift with prolonged stimuli, thereby changing the repertoire and density of ARs and GPCRs. Skin deposits of nitrogen (NO and NO ) are converted to NO and promote vasodilation independent of the endothelium in the presence of ultraviolet A irradiation, a common trigger in rosacea. An inflammatory milieu and heightened neuronal activity are present in rosacea, and it is possible that worsening erythema could represent an exaggerated compensatory neuroinflammatory mechanism of the vasculature aside from what is suggested here, such as release of neuropeptides and systemic adrenergic or other vasoactive peptides. Best results may be obtained when rosacea-associated inflammation is managed using the traditional rosacea treatments in conjunction with brimonidine therapy.

Therefore, it explores a wider range of data and has the potential to prioritize the chemical -health outcome connections, thus allowing further targeted studies.

While some hydrated cisplatin binds to nuclear DNA (nDNA), the majority interacts with nucleophilic sites on other molecules, including mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Notably, cisplatin shows higher affinity for mtDNA than nDNA. Mitochondria are particularly susceptible to cisplatin-induced damage due to their lack of repair mechanisms, absence of protective histones, and negative internal charge. This interaction with both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA contributes to cisplatin ' s complex cellular effects. D.A. Barnes et al. Fig. 5.

These processes lead to altered levels of the reproductive hormones' reservoir and HPG axis dysregulation, which can induce reproductive disorders.

There is one agonist subset model with optimal performance with only 6 assays, but to achieve optimal performance for the antagonist mode, models can be built with as few as 5 assays. Optimal models for agonism are non-optimal for antagonism and vice versa (see Fig. 3). In both cases, the best subset of assays used multiple technologies and cell types, at different nodes in the AR signaling pathway. The best agonist subset models primarily used assays from the agonist nodes in Fig. 1 (N1-N5), while the best antagonist models used assays from the antagonist nodes (N1, N2, N6 and N7). This is all consistent with the results of the corresponding ER agonist subset modeling approach. As observed here, the sensitivity of a single assay for AR pathway activity (in agonist or antagonist mode) cannot achieve the same BA and sensitivity of a multi-assay model, emphasizing the need for an integrated approach to testing and assessment (IATA ) that employ multiple assays with different sources of potential interference, domains of applicability, and coverage of key biological events. We note here that the approach taken in this work is intended to provide flexibility in precisely which assays (potentially including in silico models) one would need to run to determine AR activity."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

As shown in this study, Sf9 parental cells were susceptible to cytotoxicity of test insecticides with LC 50 values less than 50 µM. Sensitivity of insect Sf9 cells to cytotoxic effects of compounds such as fungal metabolites, pyridalyl insecticide have been reported. Thus susceptibility of Sf9 parental cells to insecticide cytotoxicity observed in the present study is advantageous to determining capability of P450 enzymes in detoxifying insecticides. Capability of P450 in detoxifying cytotoxic xenochemicals were previously reported using insect cells expressing P450 enzyme via baculovirusdirected expression. Moreover Sf21 cells expressing human CYP1A1 were used to investigate toxicity of naphthalene. The results of this study revealed that CYP6P7 and CYP6AA3 could function in metabolizing of permethrin, cypermethrin, and deltamethrin, however role in metabolisms of bioallethrin, chlorpyrifos and propoxur was not observed. Thus abilities of CYP6P7 and CYP6AA3 in detoxifying pyrethroids support their role in conferring deltamethrin resistance in An. minimus mosquito. A difference was noted in that while CYP6AA3 showed metabolic activity and cytoprotective activity against λ -cyhalothrin, these capabilities were not observed for CYP6P7. The results thus indicated differences in properties of these two enzymes. A characteristic of P450s that has been noted is their variation in substrate specificity such as a single P450 could metabolize more than one substrate."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"permethrin\",\"KE\",\"cytotoxicity in Sf9 cells\"\n\"cypermethrin\",\"KE\",\"cytotoxicity in Sf9 cells\"\n\"deltamethrin\",\"KE\",\"cytotoxicity in Sf9 cells\"\n\"bioallethrin\",\"KE\",\"cytotoxicity in Sf9 cells\"\n\"chlorpyrifos\",\"KE\",\"cytotoxicity in Sf9 cells\"\n\"propoxur\",\"KE\",\"cytotoxicity in Sf9 cells\"\n\"chlorpyrifos\",\"KE\",\"no metabolism by CYP6AA3\"\n\"propoxur\",\"KE\",\"no metabolism by CYP6AA3\""}]}

Cognitive impairment is a core feature of schizophrenia, often emerging before psychotic symptoms and persisting throughout the illness, significantly impacting long term outcomes. Antipsychotics are the primary treatment used for patients with schizophrenia and are effective in reducing positive symptoms in some but do not consistently improve cognitive function, leaving an unmet need. Despite decades of drug discovery efforts, no pro cognitive compounds have been approved. The challenge lies in the complex aetiology of schizophrenia, which involves multiple neurotransmitter systems, including dopaminergic, serotonergic, glutamatergic, adrenergic and cholinergic pathways. Over the past two decades, growing interest in the role of the α7 nAChR in the cognitive deficits of schizophrenia has provided insights into disease mechanisms and potential treatments, supported by behavioural, neurobiological and genetic evidence. Firstly, individuals with schizophrenia have a much higher prevalence of tobacco use (70-85%) compared to the general population (~20%), and they tend to extract more nicotine and smoke more cigarettes per day. This increased nicotine consumption is thought to be a form of self medication for cognitive symptoms."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"nicotine\",\"AO\",\"Increased risk of cognitive impairment and AD (smoking)\""}]}

Recently, Yadav et al. showed that transmembrane BAX inhibitor motif containing 6 (TMBIM6) protects human kidney cells from CsA-induced nephrotoxicity by enhancing autophagy and activating lysosomes. Specifically, when TMBIM6 was overexpressed in CsAtreated human kidney cells, it increased LC3II expression, lysosomal activity, and cell viability and suppressed the ER stress response. The TMBIM6-induced autophagy associated with PRKAA activation and mTORC1 suppression. TMBIM6 knockout mice were more susceptible to CsA nephrotoxicity than wild-type mice. Thus, TMBIM6 protects kidney cells from CsA-induced nephrotoxity by enhancing autophagy and upregulating lysosomal activity via the PRKAA-mTORC1 pathway. The above studies suggest that CsA activates oxidative stress and autophagy. Autophagy attenuates ER stress-induced toxicity, including nephrotoxicity. At present, the mechanism(s) that underlie the latter mechanism remain poorly understood. In particular, it is not clear which factors drive a CsA-treated cell to either undergo apoptotic death or autophagy and thus cell survival. However, it is possible that the duration of CsA exposure shapes this balance. Han et al. showed that while short-term CsA treatment activates the ER stress response (as shown by elevated levels of BiP mRNA and protein), long-term CsA treatment reduces ER stress."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

In contrast, Eya3 binds B55 in an extended manner. Superimposing all five B55 complexes with regulators and substrates showed that only p107 and FAM122A bind B55 in identical conformations; the remaining regulators bind the wall and platform pockets in distinct conformations (Fig. 6c-g). This shows that B55-interacting proteins (substrates and regulators) use different combinatorial strategies to recruit B55 through the wall and platform binding pockets, suggesting that predicting novel B55 substrates and regulators from sequence alone will be challenging. In addition to defining substrate binding, the PP2A:B55-p107 structure, coupled with atomic-resolution dephosphorylation assays, showed that, while the p107 interdomain is robustly phosphorylated by CDK2-cyclin A2 on two residues, S615 p107 and S640p107, it is only pS640p107 and not pS615 p107 that is readily dephosphorylated by PP2A:B55 (Fig. 4). This preference in phosphosite dephosphorylation is readily explained by the PP2A:B55-p107 structure. Specifically, in the bound state, S615 p107 is associated with B55 at the wall interaction surface, more than 40 Å away from the PP2Ac catalytic pocket. In contrast, in the bound state, S640 p107 is positioned directly adjacent to the active site (Fig. 6h, top), making substrate engagement dephosphorylation readily achievable. In this way, B55 binding ensures that only specific phosphosites (that is, pS640 a residue whose phosphorylation status determines p107 activity ) are preferentially dephosphorylated (Fig. 6h, bottom)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"p107\",\"KE\",\"is phosphorylated by CDK2–cyclin A2 at S615 and S640\"\n\"p107\",\"KE\",\"S615 positioning prevents dephosphorylation while bound\"\n\"p107\",\"MIE\",\"inhibits PP2A:B55 catalytic activity on a small substrate\"\n\"p107\",\"KE\",\"PP2A:B55 reverses CDK phosphorylation to activate p107\"\n\"p107\",\"KE\",\"pS640 is the primary PP2A:B55 target site\"\n\"Eya3\",\"MIE\",\"weakly inhibits PP2A:B55 catalytic activity on a small substrate\""}]}

To test whether p107 binding alters PP2Ac catalytic activity, we performed half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) measurements using the active site phosphomimetic DiFMUP as a pseudosubstrate. The data show that, as predicted, p107 inhibited DiFMUP dephosphorylation (IC: 245 ± 27 nM; Extended Data Table 1 and Fig. 4g). While p107 slows the dephosphorylation of DiFMUP, p107 itself is a protein substrate of PP2A:B55. p107 is phosphorylated by multiple kinases, including the proline-directed serine/threonine CDK2-cyclin A2. Of the 14 S and T residues in the p107 interdomain (aa 612-687), S615p107, S640p107 and S650p107 are followed by a proline and all have been observed to be phosphorylated in multiple phosphoproteomics studies (PhosphoSitePlus) 42; S640 p107, in particular, is important for determining the activation status of p107, with phosphorylation inactivating p107 and dephosphorylation activating p107 (ref. 31). To identify the p107 residues phosphorylated by CDK2-cyclin A2, we incubated 15 N-labeled p107 with purified CDK2-cyclin A2 and then identified the phosphorylated residues using NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 4h, step 1). The 2D [ 1 H, 15 N] HSQC spectrum of phosphop107 ( p p107) showed that CDK2-cyclin A2 fully phosphorylates 615 SP 616 and SP 641 (Fig. 4i); 650 SP 651 was not phosphorylated, likely because of its proximity to p107's cyclin A2-recruiting motif ( 654 GSAKRRLFGE 663 ) 43."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"p107\",\"MIE\",\"may hinder PP2Ac active site access\"\n\"p107\",\"KE\",\"is phosphorylated by CDK2–cyclin A2 at S615 and S640\"\n\"p107\",\"KE\",\"CDK phosphorylation inactivates p107\"\n\"DiFMUP\",\"KE\",\"is dephosphorylated by PP2A:B55 in the assay\""}]}

Magnussen The α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 nAChR) has emerged as a key target for treating cognitive dysfunction in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and schizophrenia. α7 nAChRs play essential roles in neurotransmission, neuroinflammation and synaptic plasticity, not only in neurons but also in glial cells, where they engage in metabotropic signalling. Despite promising preclinical findings, clinical trials of α7 nAChR agonists, partial agonists and positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) have yielded inconsistent results, with few achieving sustained cognitive benefits in patients. This review examines the functional properties of α7 nAChRs, ionotropic and metabotropic signalling roles, and their contribution to cognitive processes in AD and schizophrenia. We provide a comprehensive analysis of key α7 targeted compounds that advanced to clinical trials, detailing their outcomes and challenges. Additionally, we discuss major translational barriers, including receptor desensitization, pharmacokinetic limitations, inter individual variability (e.g., effects of smoking on metabolism) and species differences in preclinical models. Finally, we explore innovative strategies to improve trial success, including optimized dosing regimens, co administration with PAMs and neuroimaging techniques like PET to refine patient selection and drug evaluation. These approaches may offer a more effective pathway for developing α7 targeted cognitive therapies in AD and schizophrenia."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"α7 nAChR agonist\",\"KE\",\"Metabotropic signalling via intracellular G-proteins in glia\"\n\"α7 nAChR agonist\",\"KE\",\"Calcium influx mediates fast excitatory signalling\""}]}

However, at the same time, at a higher concentration (1 mg/kg b.w./day), this compound decreased serum estradiol and progesterone levels. A change in mammary gland morphology (including duct thickness and branching) was observed after exposure to CPF (0.1 and 2.5 mg/kg/day) in adult female rats. Breast tubulogenesis induction by activation of the AhR pathway was observed in the CPF-exposed MCF-7 line. CPF present in the environment may be directly or indirectly developmentally neurotoxic. The effects of developmental neurotoxicity will depend on the stage of brain development, the dose used, and the duration of exposure. Available animal studies indicate that sub-toxic exposure to CPF has a detrimental effect on the behavior and development of the central nervous system. During a recent meeting of experts in April 2019, studies on the effect of CPF on developmental neurotoxicity were discussed. Undeniably, research on mice and rats conducted in recent years has allowed for a better understanding of the developing brain's sensitivity to the neurotoxic effects of CPF after the consumption of contaminated food. The developmental neurotoxicity was studied in pregnant rats exposed to various levels of CPF at 0.3, 1, and 5 mg/kg b.w./day from day 6 of gestation to PND 11.

One possible mechanism that may account for the effects of chlorpyrifos oxon and carbaryl is that they were mediated by muscarinic AChR secondary to inhibition of acetylcholinesterase. Carbachol, acting through muscarinic ACh receptors, has been reported to alter neuronal activity in MEAs. Acetylcholinesterase-independent actions have been reported for these compounds, especially for chlorpyrifos oxon, including direct actions on muscarinic AChR, as well as other targets. Thus, an alternative explanation for the current results with these two compounds is that their effects were mediated via direct interaction with muscarinic AChR or other non-cholinergic actions. Further study of the responsiveness of this culture model to cholinergic compounds, including agonists and antagonists of both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors, as well as characterization of the expression of cholinergic receptors, will help to clarify its utility to detect compounds that act via cholinergic pathways. The third compound that was not detected as a hit was bifenthrin. Bifenthrin is a type I pyrethroid insecticide, which act via disruption of voltage-gated sodium channel gating kinetics. Three other pyrethroid compounds included in this study all caused effects that were greater than the hit thresholds.

These data demonstrate that enkephalinergic innervation of vlPAG is robust and differentially engaged by pain state, whereby acute pain rapidly attenuates enkephalin tone and persistence of pain recruits and increases enkephalin. Cognitive-state modulation of vlPAG opioid circuitry. The vlPAG not only passively relays peripheral nociceptive inputs or descending signals from cortical and sub-cortical areas, but also integrates these signals to update learning about ongoing pain and the contexts in which it is experienced. This suggests that cognitive factors related to pain expectation can be harnessed to influence vlPAG opioidergic circuitry and pain experience. The integrative role of vlPAG in pain and negative affect more generally has been studied in the context of fear conditioning paradigms and placebo analgesia. However, it remains unclear how genetically-defined opioidergic populations ( i.e., Oprm1 and Penk ), long-implicated in pain expectation, participate in vlPAG-mediated pain modulation. To explore this possibility, we first used a trace fear conditioning paradigm to determine how enkephalin tone or release on MORexpressing vlPAG neurons, as measured with δ Light, is regulated by cues ( i.e., conditioned stimulus, CS; tones) and contexts that signal impending noxious stimulation (i.e. unconditioned stimulus, US; shock)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Impacts on the gills and liver have also been documented. This implies that, beyond the behavioral effects derivable from neurotoxicity, respiratory disruption is a plausible effect attributable to gill toxicity. Pyrethroids selectivity for aquatic vertebrates and the marked susceptibility of fish is explainable on the basis of toxicokinetic (i.e., absorption, biotransformation, distribution, elimination) and toxicodynamic (i.e., biochemical/physiological effects) factors. Documented environmental concentrations of deltamethrin range from 1.8 to 253.0 ng L -1 in freshwater. Its toxicity to freshwater life is estimated to range from 0.0001 µ g L (48 and 96-h EC for immobilization of Daphnia magna ) to 0.75 µ g L -1 (for oxidative stress in catfish under 48 h exposures). Since the sensitivity of fish to various pesticides is species-specific and niche-specific, assessing species-specific exposures will provide information on the risk spectrum of specific pesticides. Furthermore, the lower lipophilicity (moderate aqueous solubility) (log Kow = 4.6) and lower bioavailability of deltamethrin in the presence of suspended sediment indicates that pelagic species have a greater risk likelihood than benthic species.

As AOPs are in development, and limited number has been validated, we decided to combine our approach with a manual exploration of the PubMed database. First, an automatic search was performed using the recently developed AOP-helpFinder tool, that is a hybrid approach that combined text mining procedure and graph theory, to identify linkage between BPF and biological events present in already defined AOPs. The TOXLINE database was screened to compile scientific publications mentioning BPF in a toxicological context (https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/ htmlgen? TOXLINE). To capture as much as possible of the existing information, several synonyms for BPF where used (Supplementary Table 1) that were extracted from the CompTox database (https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard). Then, to prepare the biological data, AOPs were considered. Based on the AOP-wiki database (https://aopwiki.org), a dictionary was developed. The AOPwiki database contains information related to AOPs for which mechanistic representations of toxicological effects over various level of the biological organization were reported.

Continually elevated ROS levels are known to cause oxidative damage to cells, resulting in injury or death.

There have been many studies in the literature reporting adverse effects of such chemical compounds on environmental and human health. Exposure to some of these pesticides may lead to alterations in the genetic mate rial thereby causing mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, and immunotoxicity. Endosulfan, a broad-spectrum organochlorine pesticide is classified as hazardous both by World Health Organization and the US Environmental Protection Agency. It is persistent in the environment and bioaccumulative in organisms because of its lipophilic features. High levels of endosulfan residues have been detected in several feed such as fish and bovine milk. Endosulfan is largely used worldwide and blamed for various health problems. Neurotoxicity is thought to be the essential cause of acute endosulfan toxicity as evidenced from endosulfan poisoning cases. Subchronic exposure to endosulfan has been shown to cause prominent suppression of humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in rats. Endosulfan-induced apoptosis in human T-cells leukemic cell lines has also been reported. Chlorpyrifos is an organophosphate (OP) insecticide and has been widely used since 1965. It has been claimed that chlorpyrifos is nonteratogenic, noncarcinogenic, and does not adversely affect reproductive functions. It is well-known that OP pesticides exert their toxic effects mainly through inhibition of acetyl cholinesterase in the nervous system.

It also discusses the effects of CPF on gene mutation, chromosome aberration, unscheduled DNA synthesis, and in vitro studies in somatic cells. Research on animal cell lines showed that CPF does not induce gene mutations in vitro. In addition, CPF was also found to be unable to induce chromosome aberration in in vitro tests. In turn, after the application of CPF, Abdelaziz et al. noted chromosomal aberrations in vivo and DNA damage in Comet assays both in vitro and in vivo. Cui et al. observed the effect of CPF on unscheduled DNA synthesis. However, in vivo somatic cell tests of mouse bone marrow micronucleus in RAR provided negative findings for CPF.

There were also discordant results with dieldrin where the tipping point was less potent than one in vivo study; this was due to 3000-fold differences in the in vivo doses used.

For example, FOR, a chemical known to increase steroidogenesis across all hormones, can be found in Cluster A. Additionally, atrazine, a core chemical that the OECD validation study expected to weakly induce estrogen levels as a result of aromatase induction in vitro, was also in cluster A due to concentration-dependent increases in ESTRADIOL.

Cluster C is composed of 50 chemicals with increased progestagen levels (OHPREG, OHPROG, and PROG) with simultaneous decreases across the rest of the hormones evaluated, which may result from HSD3B1 disruption. Finally, clusters D and E showed overall decreases in hormone levels with both clusters having consistent decreases in glucocorticoid and androgen levels. The clusters are distinguished from one another by estrogen responses. Cluster D, composed of 36 chemicals, consistently decreased estrogens suggesting overall inhibition of the steroidogenic pathway (ie, putative CYP11A1 inhibition, or chemical-mediated effects upstream of steroidogenesis).

The signaling pathway that leads to TGFβ 1 expression involves the activation of protein kinase Cβ, which leads to the activation of ERK. Feldman et al. also showed that when MDCK cells are treated with CsA, they develop renal epithelial barrier dysfunction that involves crosstalk between TGFβ 1 and ERK. They also found that treating the cells with TGFβ 1 in the absence of CsA also elevated TER, and that inhibiting the p38 pathway attenuates this effect. This suggests that p38 regulates CsA-induced TGFβ 1 expression. Interestingly, this research group showed that inhibiting ERK also blocked the ability of TGFβ 1 to induce TER. Thus, the crosstalking p38/TGFβ 1/ERK1/2 pathway seems to play an important role in CsA-induced modulation of renal paracellular permeability. The group of Prof. El-Mas found that the TGFβ 1/IL-2/COX-2 signaling pathway also participates in CsA-induced renal tubular atrophy and interstitialfibrosis. Papachristou et al. also showed that endothelin-1/TGFβ 1 signaling participates in CsAinduced renal dysfunction: when human tubular cells were treated with CsA, they produced endothelin-1, which is known to contribute in general to renal vascular derangement and to promote the synthesis and activation of TGFβ 1 and adhesion molecules. Furthermore, the El-Mas group found that CsAinduced renal oxidative damage in rats is due to excessive production of lipid peroxides that seems to be driven by upregulated endothelin-1/ TGFβ 1 signaling and downregulated COX-2 expression."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"CsA\",\"AO\",\"Renal tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis\"\n\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"Endothelin-1/TGF-β1 signaling participates in renal dysfunction\"\n\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"Endothelin-1 produced by tubular cells\"\n\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"Lipid peroxides driven by endothelin-1/TGF-β1 and COX-2 changes\""}]}

This morphological change contrasts with the ramified cell structure observed under control conditions, where microglia exhibit numerous thin branches extending from a smaller cell body. These findings support the transition of microglia from a resting (homeostatic) state (ramified) to an activated state (ameboid) upon LPS stimulation (Fig. 3d). Additionally, increasing the seeding density of hiMG improved the dynamic range of the TNFα assay while lowering EC values of LPS (Fig. 3e). For the IL-6 assay, a seeding density of 1000 hiMGs per well provided the largest assay window, despite higher cell densities resulting in lower EC values for LPS (Fig. 3f). This reduced signal ratio at higher densities may stem from increased basal signal, more rapid nutrient consumption, or accumulation of metabolic waste, potentially retarding cell function or altering cytokine expression. Consequently, we selected 1000 hiMGs per well as the optimal cell density for subsequent testing, which yielded over a three-fold increase in signal for both cytokine detection assays. Furthermore, these HTRF-based cytokine detection assays confirmed that LPS effectively stimulated IL-6 secretion in two other human microglial cell lines, specifically HMC3 and IM-HM, with EC values of 49.30 ng/ml and 14.30 ng/ml, respectively (Fig. 3g).

CsA also induces nephrotoxicity by directly inducing tubular cell apoptosis. Indeed, renal biopsy specimens from patients with CsA nephrotoxicity always exhibit apoptosis. In addition, CsA is directly toxic to LLC-PK1 renal tubular cells and that this effect associates with DNA synthesis inhibition and the induction of apoptosis that is mediated by the Fas antigen-ligand system. Notably, Granchi et al. showed recently that when renal tubular cells are injured by CsA, their cell calcium levels rise and activate the expression of the glucose transporter GLUT1, which is a stress response protein. This is significant because Kim et al. reported many years previously that GLUT1 mediates the cytotoxicity of CsA in tubular cells. Thus, it appears that CsA increases the calcium levels of renal tubular cells: this activates GLUT1, which in turn upregulates glycolysis. This metabolic response may play a prominent role in the recovery of tubules that were injured by CsA.

These include neurotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, ototoxicity, cardiotoxicity, myelosuppression, and dose-limiting nephrotoxicity. Genetic variations in drug transporter activity can have implications in an individual ' s susceptibility to (Pt) chemotherapeutics. Several generations of Pt chemotherapeutics have been developed to mitigate nephrotoxicity. Cisplatin was the first generation of Pt-based antineoplastics approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1978. Classified as an alkylating agent, cisplatin was shown to inhibit cell division of bacteria and was developed as a treatment for mesotheliomas. However, concerns emerged following reports of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity, most notably the prevalence of acute kidney injury (AKI) and ATN following treatment (Table 1). This increased susceptibility to severe nephrotoxicity during these early clinical trials led to the revision of cisplatin as an applicable chemotherapeutic agent. Therefore, many of the initial attempts of Pt drug development were to determine less-toxic analogues of cisplatin that retained similar levels of anticancer activity (Fig. 1). Carboplatin, the second-generation Pt drug approved by the FDA in 1989, exhibits a mechanism of action similar to cisplatin but with fewer and less severe side effects. This improved safety profile is attributed to its reduced aquation rate; a result of its bidentate cyclobutane dicarboxylate ligand. Due to its decreased nephrotoxicity, carboplatin was identified as a more suitable option for aggressive, high-dose chemotherapy."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Cisplatin\",\"AO\",\"Acute kidney injury (AKI)\"\n\"Carboplatin\",\"KE\",\"Reduced aquation rate and increased stability\""}]}

Correspondingly, NAPQI is the initial cause of hepatotoxicity and once again defines the MIE. Indeed, for a wide range of drugs quinoneimines are implicated in liver injury as summarized in supplementary Table S1. Diclofenac caused significant regulation of CYP monooxygenases after single and repeated treatment of mice. Independent investigations also support the key role of the acyl glucuronide produced by uridine diphosphoglucuronosyl transferase as a molecular initiation event, and among NSAIDs the salicyl acyl glucuronide derived from aspirin is a further example. Thus, reactive metabolites are formed by hepatocytes, neutrophils and Kupffer cells with benzoquinone imine intermediates and acyl glucuronides being particularly harmful. If not sufficiently detoxified the reactive metabolites damage organelles, proteins and membrane lipids and eventually trigger programmed cell death. In specific, the accumulation of the reactive metabolite triggers oxidative stress and mitochondrial permeability transitions, i.e., mitochondrial toxicity by inhibiting ATP synthesis that leads to hepatocellular damage. Next to direct effects the reactive metabolites can covalently bind to proteins to form adducts. These function as neoantigens and are sensed and phagocytozed by APCs. Through interaction with the major histocompatibility complex APCs elicit B and T cell responses. In addition, diclofenac acyl glucuronide inhibits the Mrp2 transport.

Anti-CXCR4 antibodies have been developed to increase the specificity and hence reduce the potential for off target effects often seen with small molecules.

Furthermore, we applied the 'owas\\_qgcomp' function, using the default setting of a linear effect across quantiles of the mixture, to analyze the associations between tertiles of PFAS mixtures and each protein using quantile g-computation. QGComp is a novel analytical approach used in environmental mixture analysis to estimate the impact of simultaneously increasing all exposures by one quantile. This method allows for the estimation of both the exposure mixture effect and individual contributions to that mixture, without the need for assuming directional homogeneity, linearity, and additivity like weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression.

In brief, PCA was performed on all exposures and all outcomes independently in each cohort to calculate the eigenvalues.

Moreover, TGFβ 1 usually exerts its CsA-induced pathological effects on the kidney via the MAPK pathway, particularly ERK and p38. p38/TGFβ 1/ERK1/2 plays an important role in the CsA-induced impairment of renal paracellular permeability. The TGFβ 1/IL-2/ COX-2 crosstalking pathway also participates in CsA-induced renal tubular atrophy and interstitialfibrosis. Moreover, the oxidative stress induced by CsA involves endothelin-1/TGFβ 1 signaling. Thus, TGFβ 1 crosstalks closely with other signaling pathways, thereby contributing to CsA nephrotoxicity. The role of Ca in CsA nephrotoxicity is relatively less well understood than the role of other signaling molecules. However, several in vitro and in vivo studies show that it participates in CsA renal injury. Thus, Calderaro et al. showed that when the LLC-PK1 porcine proximal tubule-like cell line is treated with CsA, it amplifies Ca 2+ signaling after exposure to agents that trigger intracellular Ca release. This effect is achieved by CsA-mediated inhibition of the plasma membrane Ca 2+ pump, which prevents Ca 2+ export. Thus, CsA increases the sensitivity of the renal cells to events that induce Ca 2+ signaling. This augmentation of Ca 2+ signaling, which plays an essential role in many cellular functions, is likely to contribute significantly to the side effects induced by CsA. da Costa et al."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"CsA\",\"AO\",\"Renal tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis\"\n\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"Amplifies Ca2+ signaling sensitivity\"\n\"CsA\",\"AO\",\"Tubular atrophy and tubulointerstitial fibrosis\"\n\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"Endothelin-1/TGF-β1 signaling participates in renal dysfunction\""}]}

In the context of injury, the lateral (lPAG) and ventrolateral columns (vlPAG) receive direct ascending nociceptive signals from the spinal cord and descending cortical and subcortical inputs that facilitate ongoing pain modulation. The convergence of pain information in the vlPAG is further modified by µ opioid receptors (MORs) engaged by exogenous opioid drugs and endogenous MOR agonists, primarily met and leuenkephalin peptides. For example, both direct microinfusion of MOR agonists and enkephalinase inhibitor into posterior vlPAG produced robust antinociception that could be blocked with MOR antagonist. This suggests that endogenous enkephalins released in vlPAG inhibit MOR-expressing neurons and thereby activate the canonical descending disinhibition pathway to rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) to produce analgesia via indirect control of the dorsal horn. Foundational work supported excitatory, analgesic connectivity between PAG and RVM as microinfusion of glutamate into the vlPAG increased RVM cellular activity and reduced nociceptive reflexive paw withdrawal.

Our attempts to prepare 5l via the thio-Reformatsky reaction, using experimental procedure reported for the thio-Reformatsky reaction of N -Phprotected thioamides failed. Similar failures are reported by others, and the conversion of N -Boc thioamides into enamino carbonyl compounds remains a challenge. Examples presented in Table 2 also show that the coupling reaction is successful for cyclic-( 5a -5g ) and acyclically-positioned ( 5h, 5i and 5k ) thioamides.

Next, we explored the scope of diazo compounds in this coupling reaction (Table 3). We tested ketones and esters. Ketones gave excellent yields of the coupled products ( 5m -5r ), and both electron-donating and withdrawing groups on diazo compounds gave enamino carbonyl products (compare 5m -5p ) in excellent yields.

In a recent study examining sodium and calcium flux in mouse cortical neurons, bifenthrin had low efficacy in modulation of both responses. This lack of efficacy may underlie the response in the present study. However, under conditions where inhibitory GABAergic neurotransmission is blocked, bifenthrin reduced network firing rate in a concentration-dependent manner and has an IC value in the nM range. Thus, bifenthrin could be considered a false negative in the current study. The need for in vitro assays to screen chemicals for their hazard potential is well recognized. The nervous system presents unique challenges with respect to screening assays because its functional output involves spatial and temporal patterns of electrical activity that are influenced by the phenotypes of various cells that comprise different neuronal pathways. For in vitro assays based on biochemical and morphological endpoints, it is often difficult or not possible to predict how changes in these endpoints may ultimately influence neuronal function. In addition, there are many different known toxicity pathways in the nervous system that will result in significant, and sometimes fatal, toxicity outcomes prior to or in the absence of changes in protein levels or gene expression. Neurophysiology has been utilized for many decades as a sensitive indicator of chemical neurotoxicity. However, many neurophysiological approaches lack the throughput necessary to be efficient screens for neuroactivity/toxicity."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

To rule out a false negative result in zebrafish embryo assays due to lack of uptake, the uptake of both the parent and the metabolite at the highest concentrations was determined at 120 hpf. The assessment revealed that the larvae poorly took up LTC. In zebrafish embryos/ larvae, the concentration was between 0.0000029 mg/mL (i.e., 0.0170 µ M) and 0.0010000 mg/mL (i.e., 5.8751 µ M; the upper limit of quantification), which is ~1,000 times lower than the plasma concentration for which skeletal effects were seen in mice (i.e., 1.20 ± 0.35 mg/ml ). For ECA, no concentrations above the LOD could be detected. This means that the metabolite might not have been taken up by the embryos/larvae or might have been present in concentrations too low to detect. This limited uptake of LTC and lack of uptake of ECA is likely due to their relatively hydrophilic properties, as it has been shown that the membrane of the skin of embryos can form an obstacle for the uptake of hydrophilic compounds. Consequently, potential teratogenic properties of LTC and ECA might have been missed. This emphasizes the need to always determine uptake, especially for compounds that are negative in zebrafish embryo assays. Otherwise, this can lead to misinterpretation of the results as the compound seems not teratogenic while it was not taken up."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"LTC\",\"KE\",\"poor uptake in larvae\""}]}

Estrogen receptors (ER) are a group of nuclear receptors located in the nucleus of cells that mediate the genotypic effects of estrogen and are vital for the normal physiological effects of estrogen. In addition, studies have shown that ER is also involved in the regulation and maintenance of memory functions in the hippocampus of the central nervous system, the regulation of cardiovascular functions such as blood pressure and cardioprotection, the regulation of multifunctional haematopoietic stem cell differentiation, etc."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

However, other studies indicate that sub-toxic exposure to CPF in developing organisms and the assessment of neurotoxicity should be further investigated as the available studies appear to be controversial and do not fully clarify this issue. One of the causes of neurodegeneration is the effect not only on the peripheral nervous system but also on the central one, in which not only cholinesterases but also decarboxylases are extremely important, catalyzing the formation of the necessary hormones to control many processes. Recently published assessments of the effects of CPF on these enzymes have shown a decrease in activity, which leads to the development of autism, Parkinson's disease, etc. In addition, the penetration of CPF is shown not only in the placenta, liver, and kidneys but also in the brain. CPF and its derivatives (mainly CPF-ox) are potent irreversible inhibitors of AChE, which is responsible for the breakdown of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. The CPF oxygen analogue-CPF-ox-is formed in the process of catalysis by the cytochrome P450dependent mono-oxygenase system. The decreased activity of AChE after exposure to CPF leads to increased activity of cholinergic synapses in neurons and neuromuscular junctions. The exposure of mammals to high concentrations of CPF and its derivatives can cause acute lethality from respiratory failure, resulting from both central and peripheral effects. The action of CPF may disrupt the spatial structure of the enzyme by attacking the active hydroxyl group of the AChE serine."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"CPF-ox\",\"MIE\",\"Irreversible AChE inhibition by oxon metabolite\"\n\"CPF\",\"AO\",\"Decreased cognition after prenatal exposure\"\n\"CPF\",\"KE\",\"Decreased glutathione peroxidase activity\"\n\"CPF\",\"AO\",\"Cholinergic signs in offspring\"\n\"CPF\",\"AO\",\"Deficits in learning (rat study)\"\n\"CPF\",\"KE\",\"Increased pancreatic polypeptide\"\n\"CPF-ox\",\"KE\",\"Principal/toxic metabolite responsible for cholinesterase inhibition\""}]}

Studies examining the impact of environmental exposures on DNA methylation have often focused on the global methylation, using various approaches including the examination of repetitive elements as surrogate markers of global methylation 20. Specifically, phthalate metabolite levels are inversely correlated to birth weight and positively associated with the methylation of LINE-1 and IGF-2 in term placenta 21,22.

EDCs including phthalates are risk factors for adverse health outcomes, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear.

It is difficult to compare the sensitivity of this assay to other published, in vitro assays for neurotoxicity testing because these assays have tested fewer compounds (6-40 compounds) and do not directly report the sensitivity of the assay.

We found that AD-214 binds to hCXCR4 on CHO cells with an estimated K of 107.1 pM (Figure 1f). No binding to the parental empty vector control CHO line was detected and CHO-hCXCR4 cells treated with control i-body, 21H5-Fc (DAPA), showed no binding, demonstrating that binding of AD-214 to hCXCR4 was specific. In a cell line expressing (~5-fold) lower levels of CXCR4 (U266, Figure S2a), AD-214's affinity was similarly high (K: 115 pM) (Figure S2b). Although AD-214 binding to CXCR4 expressed on cells is slightly lower than the binding to CXCR4 on virus-like particles as measured by SPR, the affinity is nevertheless very high and clinically relevant. We next examined whether AD-214 could affect the downstream signaling of CXCR4 in response to its ligand CXCL12. CXCL12 binding to CXCR4 induces intracellular signaling via ß-arrestin recruitment and a reduction in cAMP levels that can ultimately lead to cell proliferation and migration. In addition, ligand binding can lead to receptor internalization, via an endocytic pathway. Therefore, we examined the effect of AD214 on CXCL12 activation of β-arrestin, cAMP, as well as receptor internalization (Figure 2a-e). The ability of AD-214 to antagonize CXCL12-mediated internalization of CXCR4, recruitment of β-arrestin, and downregulation of cAMP was investigated in HEK293FT cells transiently expressing human CXCR4."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"AD-214\",\"MIE\",\"Binds CXCR4\"\n\"CXCL12\",\"MIE\",\"CXCL12 binds CXCR4 to activate signaling\"\n\"AD-214\",\"KE\",\"Antagonizes CXCL12-mediated CXCR4 internalization\"\n\"CXCL12\",\"KE\",\"Induces CXCR4 internalization\"\n\"AD-214\",\"KE\",\"Antagonizes CXCL12-mediated cAMP reduction\"\n\"CXCL12\",\"KE\",\"Induces β-arrestin recruitment\"\n\"AD-214\",\"KE\",\"Antagonizes CXCL12-mediated β-arrestin recruitment\"\n\"CXCL12\",\"KE\",\"Reduces cAMP levels\""}]}

While it is possible that the lack of effects of neonicotinoid compounds in the MEAs, which have a lower affinity for mammalian than insect nicotinic receptors, could be the ''true'' response, the lack of effect of nicotine prevents this conclusion from being made with any confidence and indicates that a limitation using wMFR in primary cortical cultures for screening may be a lack of sensitivity to nicotinic compounds.

It can be seen from Fig. 2 that the RMSD values of the permethrin complex gradually converge to equilibrium after 20 ns, which means that the system has reached a balanced state. In contrast, the RMSD of the bifenthrin complex remained in a fluctuating situation throughout the simulation, which implies that the stability of the complex is not satisfactory. It can also be seen that the RMSD of the permethrin complex was lower than that of the bifenthrin complex for the majority of the simulation, suggesting a greater stability of the permethrin complex.

Exposure to organophosphates causes, in addition to congenital defects, cognitive and neurobehavioral deficits. These pesticides increased the risk of breast cancer, and maternal exposure was also associated with childhood development of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Maternal genotoxic exposition can induce non-homologous chromosome rearrangements and initiate neoplasm. The chronic toxicity of CPF is difficult to determine, and in order to obtain more information, selected animal species should be exposed to regularly repeated low doses of this pesticide. Defects in newborn development, rare/unusual tumors, endocrine disruption, or nerve disorders are some of the typical chronic effects that occur after contact with the pesticide. Therefore, it is easier to evaluate the acute toxicity of a pesticide than determine the dose of its chronic toxicity. Recent studies have suggested that exposure to CPF can also affect the endocrine system, in particular thyroid and adrenal gland homeostasis, which was observed in animal and human models. Numerous in vitro studies conducted by Aldridge et al. indicated that CPF may operate by other mechanisms. In addition, they showed that exposure to this substance below the toxicity threshold may have a destructive effect on neural cell development, cell differentiation, and synaptogenesis. In vivo mouse model studies conducted by Salazar-Arredondo et al. indicated serious defects in spermatogenesis, resulting in a reduction in sperm quality. Therefore, CPF could be considered as an endocrine-disrupting compound."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"CPF\",\"KE\",\"Destructive effect on neural cell development\"\n\"CPF\",\"AO\",\"Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia associated with maternal exposure\"\n\"CPF\",\"KE\",\"Thyroid and adrenal gland homeostasis affected\"\n\"CPF\",\"KE\",\"Destructive effect on cell differentiation\"\n\"CPF\",\"KE\",\"Destructive effect on synaptogenesis\"\n\"CPF\",\"AO\",\"Increased risk of prostate cancer\"\n\"CPF\",\"AO\",\"Defects in spermatogenesis / reduced semen quality\"\n\"CPF\",\"KE\",\"Sperm morphological malformations\""}]}

The disruption of PPARG has also been associated with later KEs and AOs such as ovarian dysfunction and female subfertility. The weight of evidence on the effect of DEHP through this path reveals weak to moderate dose-response and temporal concordance between KEs. The same DEHP concentration of 400 µM or 50 µM decreases aromatase expression and lowers E2 production in granulosa cells. Moreover, 20 µg DEHP/kg bw/day decreases E2 in the ovary and serum in mice. However, some studies showed that human relevant concentration of DEHP (10 nM) effects the aromatase expression without changing the E2 production. A lack of DEHP-mediated effect on aromatase expression and E2 production, and increase in E2 biosynthesis have also been demonstrated.

However, they denote a certain developmental time, the fetal period, and during this time especially early neurodevelopmental processes, like the switch from proliferation to initial migration and differentiation. However, how the assays are set up at the moment using an in vitro time of only 5 days, the developmental KEs are not followed to full cell maturity. Neurons stay in a mostly bipolar state and also oligodendrocytes do not reach the full myelinating condition. For studying earlier time-points during development, i.e. the embryonic period, or more mature endpoints, i.e. neuronal network formation and function or neuronal myelination, other assays are necessary. The current DNT IVB is evolving to close such biological gaps, yet thorough scientific validation has to be a prerequisite for each novel test system/method to proceed from hazard characterizationfinally to contributing to risk assessment for DNT using NAMs. Our data provide the rationale for the scientific validity of the endpoints depicted with the Neurosphere Assays. Hence, the DNT IVB, with the Neurosphere Assay as an integral part, is on a solid way to regulatory acceptance.

While the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of KRG are not clear, KRG promoted the autophagy-downregulating AKT/ mTOR pathway. It also reduced the expression of AMP-activated protein kinase, which promotes autophagy. Several other studies also suggest that CsA-induced autophagy may promote CsA nephrotoxicity. Cheng et al. reported that CsA decreases the survival of renal tubular cells and that this nephrotoxicity associates with inhibition of the phosphorylation of mTOR and AktSer473. Since Akt phosphorylation activates mTOR and inhibits both programmed cell death (including apoptosis) and autophagy, it is likely that the downregulation of the AKT/ mTOR pathway in the renal cells suppresses autophagy. That this reduces renal cell survival is supported by the fact that Akt is believed to be an important factor for cell survival. In addition, several other studies showed that CsA treatment induces rat renal dysfunction, tubulointerstitial in flammation, andfibrosis, and that these phenomena were accompanied by increased expression of LC3II, caspase-3, and the DNA damage biomarker 8-hydroxy-2 deoxyguanosine. In summary, increasing lines of evidence suggest that autophagy is involved in CsA nephrotoxixity. A large number of studies show that autophagy protects renal tubular cells from CsA-induced nephrotoxicity. Moreover, the autophagy marker LC3II is easily detected in CsA nephrotoxicity and could serve as a biomarker. TMBIM6 may prevent CsA-induced nephrotoxity by upregulating autophagy through the PRKAA-mTORC1 pathway."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"Active caspase-3 increased and colocalized with LC3II\"\n\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"ERK1/2 phosphorylation and barrier effects\"\n\"KRG\",\"KE\",\"Decreases LC3II and beclin-1 and autophagic vacuoles\"\n\"KRG\",\"AO\",\"Improves renal function and reduces fibrosis in CsA-treated mice\""}]}

Pyrethroid insecticides are currently used worldwide in agriculture and for vector control, however long-term extensive use of insecticides has been a major cause of development of insecticide resistance among mosquito populations. Con sequently, resistance can lead to reduced efficacy of vector control programme. Pyrethroid resistance in mosquito vectors of malaria has been reported in several countries in Africa and Southeast Asia, including Thailand. Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) comprise a superfamily of enzymes that catalyze metabolisms of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds, including insecticides. Examinations of various insects have suggested involvement of P450s in resistance to different insecticides, by virtue of enhanced expression of P450s and thus increased detoxification of insecticides. Overexpression of P450s has been observed in several pyrethroid resistant insects such as increased expression of CYP6D1 has been found in pyrethroid resistant Musca domestica, CYP6P3 and CYP6M2 in multiple pyrethroid resistant Anopheles gambiae. Anopheles minimus is one of malaria vectors in Southeast Asia, including Thailand, Loas, Cambodia, and Vietnam. We previously determined that P450 enzymes might act as a primary route of deltamethrin detoxification during laboratory selection for deltamethrin resistance in An. minimus. In parallel during selection, increased mRNA expression of CYP6P7 and CYP6AA3 was observed. Thus CYP6P7 and CYP6AA3 could be implicated to play a role in detoxification of deltamethrin in this mosquito.

In males, chemical-mediated decreases in androgen levels as a result of HSD3B inhibition, CYP17A1 inhibition, or modulation of CYP19A1 activity have been associated with testicular dysgenesis syndrome and adverse reproductive effects. For example, atrazine is an herbicide known to disrupt steroidogenesis and was one of the core chemicals in the OECD interlaboratory validation studies eliciting concentrationdependent effects on both TESTO and ESTRADIOL. Atrazinemediated adverse reproductive effects in rodents have been attributed to the disruption of steroidogenesis in light of the fact that it does not interact with nuclear receptors, which was also confirmed in ToxCast assays where it does not result in any effects in AR or ER assays. Similarly, the fungicide PRO has in vivo anti-androgenic effects across species including fish, rodents, and frogs as a result of CYP17A1 inhibition which disrupts steroidogenesis leading to adverse effects on sexual development.

Neurons expressing µ opioid receptors encode active nociceptive states, whereas enkephalin-releasing neurons drive pain relief during recovery from injury, in response to learned fear predictions, and during placebo analgesia. Finally, by leveraging the functional effects of placebo analgesia, we used direct optogenetic activation of vlPAG enkephalin neurons to drive opioid peptide release, resulting in a robust reduction in pain. These findings show that diverse need states converge on a shared midbrain circuit that releases endogenous opioids with high spatiotemporal precision to suppress nociceptive activity and promote analgesia. The aversive experience of pain entails a large, interconnected brain network, with diverse functions in sensory, affective, motivational, cognitive and homeostatic processes that collectively generate behavioral repertoires to limit and avoid harm. Thus, pain is shaped not only by the immediate noxious event, but also the context in which it is experienced and the learned expectations surrounding how and when nociceptive processes will be engaged.

Overall, the limited available clinical data suggest that statins reduce brain Aβ levels, exert a lowering or neutral effect on CSF Aβ levels, and have a complex effect on circulating Aβ ( Table 2 ). These findings suggest drug rather than class-specific effects of statins but other confounding factors cannot be excluded, highlighting the need for further research. For example, although statins may decrease amyloid deposition in the brain, they may increase circulating levels by translocating this peptide from the brain to the periphery.

Likewise, activated NMDA receptors stimulate neuronal NO-synthase activity with increased production of NO. At the postsynaptic neuron NO activates the guanyl cyclase, and through retrograde diffusion NO reinforces the glutamatergic signaling in the presynaptic neuron thereby reinforcing nociception. NO may also induce an antinociceptive effect. In addition, diclofenac suppresses activity of the neuropeptide substance P and is also a partial agonist of PPAR ɣ to augment lipogenesis. AOP for immune-mediated hepatitis in mice Diclofenac treatments caused an increase in serum biochemistry markers for liver injury (ALT and AST), and histopathology showed hepatomegaly, hepatocyte swelling, glycogen depletion, eosinophilic hepatocytes and cholesterolosis. Moreover, fatal acute liver failure was observed at a dose of 150 mg/kg. The genomic and biochemical validation study revealed immune-mediated responses to be considerably induced after diclofenac treatment. Drug-induced hepatitis is a multistep process and frequently involves reactive metabolites which subsequently form drug-protein adducts. These are sensed by antigen-presenting cells to elicit innate and adaptive immune responses.

Together these data indicate that some RV-induced effects in mammals are cumulative and partially reversible, though recovery is dependent on the exposure timing, duration, and concentration, as well as the endpoint evaluated. The effects of RV on C. elegans developmental delays increased with continuous exposure duration, with significant cumulative effects on delay to successive developmental stages (Fig. 4A). In early-only RV exposures, delays to post-exposure milestones were significantly reduced but still present and dose-responsive (Fig. 4B), consistent with a partially reversible RV developmental effect. This finding is in stark contrast to an earlier wDAT study with cannabidiol (CBD), that found increased delays to the third larval stage with early-only CBD relative to continuous exposures, consistent with a withdrawal effect after removal of a molecule that can activate signaling cascades involved in development. Together these data suggest that a 4-day assay in C. elegans can model chronic and cumulative developmental exposure effects and differentiate them from acute, irreversible, and withdrawal-like effects. In mammals, reduced fetal body weight and locomotor changes are general toxicity endpoints that can reflect other, more specific developmental adverse outcomes such as teratogenesis, neurotoxicity, organ targeted effects, and/or neonatal complications.

A potential limitation of our study was the use of a single time point urine measurement to determine phthalate exposure. However, several prior studies have demonstrated that a single measurement of select phthalate biomarkers remains consistent throughout pregnancy 45,46. Another potential limitation of this study is that only a subset of samples was used for expression analysis due to our strict inclusion criteria related to genomic integrity. Importantly, however, the subject characteristics in this subset did not differ from the larger group of subjects. In addition, we studied first trimester placenta and the outcomes of these pregnancies had they gone to term are unknown.

Possible factors that may contribute to episodes of worsening erythema are discussed below. Impact of Concentration and/or Chronic Agonism In rosacea patients, epidermal barrier function is disturbed and stratum corneum hydration is reduced. This may lead to higher drug concentrations in skin and possibly also altered drug clearance. Differences in application techniques can affect the distribution of brimonidine and local drug concentrations. Local brimonidine concentrations may influence worsening erythema by: (1) the saturation of a -receptors on vascular smooth muscle, resulting in the binding of additional cell types or AR subtypes and/or (2) the chronic agonism of a -ARs, resulting in the downregulation and desensitization of receptors.

Several caveats should be noted regarding this analysis. First, the in vivo dose levels were simply those reported in the literature as cited in Mundy et al., 2015; these were not LOAEL values from guideline studies. Thus, it may be that other events or endpoints are more sensitive to perturbation than those examined here, either in vivo or in vitro. Second, the httk model predictions in some cases (for example the mouse data) relied on substitution of data from another species (human), as species-specific data were not available, or on other assumptions, for example, regarding chemical binding to protein.

Membranes were subsequently washed three times with wash buffer I, followed by incubation with biotinylated antibody for 2 h at room temperature, and further incubation with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)conjugated streptavidin (1:1000) for an additional 2 h at room temperature. Membranes were developed using Immobilon Forte Western HRP substrate (Millipore, WELUF0500, Rockville, MD, USA).

As an endpoint-selective control compound, BIC increased MFR to 131 /C6 13% of control values (mean /C6 s.d., n = 18). However, in several cases (8), the overall network response to BIC was either no net change or a decrease in MFR. This is consistent with previous observations in our laboratory as well as previous reports of heterogeneous network responses to bicuculline.

Current treatments have limited efficacy and significant side effects. To address these limitations, we developed AD-214, an anti-CXCR4-Fc-fusion protein composed of an anti-CXCR4 i-body (AD-114) tethered at its C terminus to constant domains 2 and 3 of the Fc region of a mutated human IgG1 lacking effector function. AD-214 binds with high affinity and specificity to CXCR4, modulates intracellular signaling, and inhibits key fibrotic pathways. Using fibrosis models, we demonstrate that AD-214 treatment significantly reduces collagen deposition and lung remodeling and has a unique mode of action. In Phase 1 clinical trials, intravenous infusion of AD-214 led to high and sustained CXCR4 receptor occupancy (RO), but whether RO and efficacy are causally linked remained to be determined. Herein, we demonstrate that CXCR4 RO by AD-214 inhibits primary human leukocyte migration, a model fibrotic process, and that migration inhibition is achievable at concentrations of AD-214 present in the serum of healthy human volunteers administered AD-214. Taken together, these data provide proof of concept for AD-214 as a novel treatment strategy for IPF and suggest that clinically feasible dosing regimens may be efficacious."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"AD-214\",\"MIE\",\"Binds CXCR4\"\n\"AD-214\",\"KE\",\"No significant effect on EMT (in these models)\"\n\"AD-214\",\"AO\",\"Reduces progression of lung fibrosis (Ashcroft decline) with q4d dosing\"\n\"AD-214\",\"KE\",\"Reduces MCP-1 (CCL2)\""}]}

In general, the highperforming agonist models use a cell-free receptor binding assay, a cofactor recruitment assay, a transactivation assay, and a cell proliferation assay. These probe the main points of the pathway (binding, cofactor-recruitment, transcript/translation and proliferation) and use different and complementary readout technologies. In general, the high performing antagonist subset models use a binding assay, a cofactor recruitment assay and two or three complementary antagonist-mode transactivation assays. As with the agonist mode, the assays probe the main nodes in the antagonist pathway (binding, coregulator interaction, and inhibition of transactivation). The main difference is that multiple assays per node are needed, likely because of factors mentioned above: most antagonists have weak potency resulting in lower signal-to-noise ratios in the assays, which make it more difficult to distinguish true positives from noisy false positives. Additionally, antagonist assays are often confounded with cytotoxicity. Given these points, we can make general recommendations for implementing new versions of these subset models. First, the currently used assays are either available commercially, or could be implemented using published protocols. With new assays, it would be necessary to calibrate the model performance against a set of reference chemicals. These might extend beyond the set used here.

The specific functions of the major signaling pathways in CsA-induced nephrotoxicity are shown in Fig. 4. The MAPK family consists of ubiquitous proline-directed proteinserine/threonine kinases that participate in the signal-transduction pathways that control intracellular events and major developmental changes in organisms. Emerging evidence shows that the MAPK signaling pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of CsA nephrotoxicity. The group of Ryan in University College Dublin, Ireland examined the ability of CsA to alter the transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) of kidney cells. TER is a measure of paracellular permeability and renal epithelial barrier function. Theyfirst showed that CsA increases the TER in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, thereby decreasing paracellular permeability, and that ERK1/2 cascade activation plays a pivotal role in this phenomenon. Their subsequent study showed that subcytotoxic doses of CsA also decreased the paracellular permeability of LLC-PK1 porcine proximal tubular epithelial cells. This change associated with increased membrane localization of the tight junction protein claudin-1 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Thus, CsA modulates the renal epithelial barrier function by altering the expression and localization of claudin-1 via the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. The same group later showed that CsA-treated human mesangial cells exhibit ROS and oxidative stress and that this is mediated by the ERK1/2 pathway. Thus, CsA activates this MAPK pathway, thereby promoting CsA-induced glomerular dysfunction and causing nephrotoxicity."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"Glomerular dysfunction\"\n\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"CsA alters claudin-1 via ERK1/2\"\n\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"ROS increased in renal mesangial cells\"\n\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"Nrf2 pathway activation in tubular epithelial cells\"\n\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"ROS linked to renal dysfunction\"\n\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"ERK1/2 mediates ROS/oxidative stress in mesangial cells\"\n\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"ERK1/2 phosphorylation and barrier effects\"\n\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"Urinary RBP increased with tubule dysfunction (biomarker event)\""}]}

An adverse intrauterine environment has a profound negative influence on the future health of an infant by increasing the risk to develop diseases such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, and cancer later in life 7-10. The placenta supplies the growing fetus with oxygen and nutrients and functions as an endocrine organ, producing an array of hormones and signaling molecules that adapt maternal physiology during pregnancy and regulate fetal organ development.

Both single chemical substances and mixtures of chemical compounds can cause neurological and immunological toxicity and carcinogenesis in animals and humans. Exposure to pesticides is highly harmful to offspring following in utero exposure and may lead to birth defects and effects on growth and normal development. Due to their high activity, ease of penetration into living organisms, resistance to environmental degradation, and influence on germline, pesticides, as endocrine disruptors, have been associated with intergenerational epigenetic inheritance. Increasingly more evidence is emerging to suggest that epigenetic information, which is faithfully passed on between cells during mitotic division, can also be passed on between generations. Therefore, it is concluded that the health phenotypes of the offspring can be acquired in an epigenetically inherited manner as a result of the environmental exposure of the parents. This environmental risk of disease has been shown to be transmitted to offspring through epigenetic mechanisms through both female and male germlines.

Considering the small dataset, these results provide proof-of-concept that, with improvements, such approaches may be useful to categorize previously uncharacterized compounds (''unknowns'') into effect classes. Overall, the PCA identified four general clusters of chemicals. The first, which included the GABA antagonists LND, BIC and RDX, consisted of compounds that caused clear increases in MFR and bursts per minute. This cluster separated most clearly from the others based on 95% confidence limits. The second cluster consisted of GLY, NIC and PTX, which separate completely from all chemicals except for DELT and FLU.

Other proportions in the GA are possible, but they may exhibit different convergence behavior. Subsequently, dual-target compounds for ADORA2A and PDE4D were generated using DualTransORGAN. We analyzed 50 compounds with the highest sums of their two bioactivity values and confirmed that the generated structures did not have the same structures as the compounds in the training set. The chemical structures generated by DualTransORGAN were structurally diverse and contained fluorine and sulfur atoms as well as polar functional groups such as hydroxy, carboxy, and cyano groups. The generated structures were rich in steric properties. Moreover, ring structures such as cyclopropane and structures containing chiral carbons were generated. The chemical structures generated by DualFASMIFRA had fewer polar functional groups and larger conjugated systems than those generated by DualTransORGAN. The generated high-scoring chemical structures of the dual-target compounds are shown in Figure S2. We investigated the distributions of the compounds generated by DualTransORGAN. Figure 2E compares the distributions of molecular weights of these compounds to those in the training dataset.

Other non-conazole fungicides which were both positive (cyazofamid, spiroxamine) and negative (prochloraz) in the NVS\\_IC assays were also positive in the MEA assay. These data indicate that some fungicides activate toxicity pathways impacting network function as measured by MEAs. However, fungicides differ from many of the other compounds tested here in two important aspects. First, the MIE or MIEs are not as clear, since even conazoles that did not activate NVS\\_IC ion channel assays impacted neuronal function in the MEAs. Perhaps this involves toxicity pathways linked to firing rate via disruptions of calcium homeostasis, as recent work by Heusinkveld et al. demonstrated that 6 fungicides (imazalil, flusilazole, fluconazole, tebuconazole, triadiamefon and cyproconazole) alter intracellular calcium homeostasis, and viability in PC12 cells. Only fluconazole, which was also inactive in the MEA assay, was without effects on calcium responses. Second, it is not clear if and how these compounds contribute to adverse outcome pathways, as many fungicides are not recognized to cause neurotoxicity. To this end, when 14 different conazole compounds were examined for effects on motor activity, including three common to those used here (diniconazole, hexaconazole and propriconazole), only triadimefon caused significant effects. Although triadimefon was not tested in the current experiments, it does alter cortical network activity in MEAs (unpublished data).

However, as we have a longer exposure window, it cannot be ruled out that these malformations would have been present if they also prolonged their exposure window. At 24 hpf, we observed embryos with smaller yolks and what seemed to be a leakage of the yolk content after exposure to 30 µ M AI, which was also not reported by Zhu et al. This yolk malformation remained for some embryos until 96 hpf. By just looking at the larvae, even without measuring the larval length, it was also noticed that some of these embryos appeared shorter. We hypothesized that a lack of sufficient nutrients due to the leakage of the yolk may have caused impeded growth. A study with potential chemotherapeutic agents also observed the combination of leaking yolks and a shorter larval length and suggested the same theory. They tested this hypothesis by puncturing the yolk of untreated zebrafish embryos at 24 hpf. The larvae that survived this intervention showed no significant difference in body length compared to the controls. This implies that a potential lack of nutrients was not the exclusive reason but that the compound itself mayhave influenced the overall cell proliferation and embryonic growth.

Though the conformational stability of the bifenthrin complex is higher than that of permethrin under the set parameters, the energy of the system may exhibit larger fluctuations as the conformation of the protein and small molecule changes during the movement, resulting in a lower stability of the overall dynamics compared to permethrin. The actual combination situation has to be proved by subsequent exposure experiments. In order to understand the flexibility of the molecular docking complexes and the partial motion characteristics of their structures in more detail, we calculated the RMSF values of the amino acid residues of the receptor during MDs. The higher the value, the more flexible the complex is during the binding process. As shown in Fig. 3, the RMSF values of the different amino acid residues are roughly the same for both complex systems due to the same active pockets docked by the small molecules. Both systems showed a larger RMSD fluctuation around residues 25, 160 and 230, which might be associated with the stability of complex formation, while the valleys were basically around residues 50, 80, 140 and 180, implying that they might belong to conservative regions."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"permethrin\",\"MIE\",\"More stable ERα complex vs bifenthrin (MD/MM-PBSA)\""}]}

DNA damage and subsequent activation of the DNA damage response pathway is a significant pathogenic mechanism affecting mitochondrial regulation and increasing production of ROS. Pt drug accumulation binds to DNA to cause template defects and arrest synthesis and replication to induce damage, with the severity and robustness of DNA damage caused can be determined by the dose, frequency and interval of administration. Repeated low-dose cisplatin injections (4 -6 doses) in C57BL/6 J mice during the kidney repair phase (days 7 -14) was shown to cause cumulative DNA damage and targeted proliferating PTECs, induced significant fibrosis and renal dysfunction, driving the transition from AKI to CKD. Platinum accumulation correlated with dose frequency, showing higher DNA-adduct burden per injection. Furthermore, dose and time-dependent differences in phosphorylated H2AX formation and double strand break formation was reported following exposure of NRK-52E cells in vitro to Pt drugs. The NRK-52E cells exhibited rapid DDR activation, poor DNA repair efficiency repair at 48 hrs, and caspase-3-mediated apoptosis.

Shafer b, * The National Academy of Sciences report on '' Toxicity testing in the 21st century '' highlighted the need for efficient in vitro methods to screen chemicals for their potential to cause toxicity. This report proposed that high-throughput/high content in vitro screening (HTS/HCS) assays would facilitate hazard identification for thousands of chemicals for which toxicological information is lacking. Such screening approaches will need to link changes measured at the cellular or subcellular level to adverse effects through a toxicity pathway so that there will be confidence in predicting toxicological outcomes in vivo. Many HTS/HCS endpoints assess changes in biochemical and/or cellular morphology markers, such as enzyme activity, receptor binding affinity, cell morphology, or physiological endpoints, such as regulation of intracellular calcium, sodium, membrane potential and ion channel function. When considering the problem of screening compounds for the potential to disrupt nervous system function, physiological assessment is crucial, as disruption of ion channels, receptors and other critical determinants of neuronal excitability are key events in the toxicity pathways of many known neurotoxicants. Disruption of neuronal excitability produces substantial and rapid disruption of nervous system physiology, and often precedes or occurs in the absence of other biochemical or morphological changes.

The blockade of α7β2 receptors may promote a feedback loop where impaired Aβ clearance leads to neuronal degeneration and further neurotoxicity. Early intervention with nicotine, cholinesterase inhibitors and α7 nAChR agonists may help delay this loop, but in later AD stages, Aβ accumulation reduces α7 nAChR availability, possibly explaining the detrimental effects of smoking. The role of α7 nAChRs in AD is complex, with both neuroprotective potential and contributions to disease progression. The cholinergic hypothesis, proposed over four decades ago, links cognitive deficits in AD to the loss of cholinergic neurons and reduced ACh release. This is supported by evidence of reduced nicotinic receptor binding sites in AD brains. While α4β2 nAChR levels consistently decrease in AD, findings on α7 nAChRs are more mixed, with reports of both increased and decreased receptor levels depending on the brain region and cell type examined. Further, variability in findings may stem from differences in sample size, disease stage and methodological approaches, such as immunohistochemical markers and PET imaging tracers used to quantify α7 expression.

The reason for the conflicting results is that phthalates and their metabolites, such as DEHP and mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate MEHP, can modulate both PPAR and prostaglandins. PPARs are necessary for maintaining a pregnancy. DEHP and its metabolites could bind to PPAR and prevent the maternal-fetal communication which allows birth to be initiated. Prostaglandins are signaling molecules, which induce contractions of the uterus, leading to birth or abortion. DEHP stimulated the secretion of prostaglandins, which could induce spontaneous abortion or preterm birth. To conclude, phthalates induce dysfunctions of pregnancy, such as prolonged pregnancy or a shortening of pregnancy and miscarriage by the modulation of PPAR and prostaglandin activity. Phthalates have an impact not only on pregnancy outcomes but also on the onset of cancer in female reproductive organs. This topic will be discussed in the next part of the chapter. 5.5.

The kidney preserves homeostasis through the management of electrolyte concentrations, extracellular fluid, acid-base balance, and the excretion of metabolic waste. The proximal tubules reabsorb most nutrients and low molecular weight proteins, and approximately 70 % of filtered solutes and water. Due to their innate functional capacity to regenerate and high number of available nephrons due to their being two kidneys, minor alterations to the structure and function of the proximal tubules tends to not have a significant impact on kidney function. However, severe proximal tubule injury often results in reduced kidney function. Many drugs and chemicals cause nephrotoxicity by inducing cell death in proximal tubules. Changes in tubule or whole kidney function due to impaired tubular reabsorption manifests as altered regulation of electrolytes, increased glucose, amino acid and low molecular weights proteins in the urine, along with elevated BUN (azotemia) and serum creatinine (sCr) levels. For example, cisplatin was shown to reduce renal blood flow and the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in as little as 3 h following administration, followed by a subsequent decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Impaired proximal tubular reabsorption and increased vascular resistance was also reported to occur within 48 -72 h following cisplatin administration.

An Arduino Uno trigger button was used to timelock the onset of the ramp in Synapse. The ramp protocol was defined to change the thermal plate temperature from 30 °C to 50 °C at a rate of 10 °C per minute.

Moreover, they interfere with NRs, e.g., AR, ER, PPAR, as the agonists and antagonists. Phthalates alter cell proliferation and apoptosis via crosstalk between MAPK, NF-kB, PI3K / Akt, and NR. This alternation can lead to impaired spermatogenesis and cancer occurrence. Phthalate exposure is associated with altered gene expression and epigenetic processes, which are regulated by NRs. The objective of this review was to analyze the phthalates' e GLYPH<11> ects on the reproductive system and their endocrine and intracellular mechanisms (see Figure 3). This paper represents an extensive review of results from in silico, in vitro, in vivo studies, and epidemiological studies with the focus on human reproductive health.

The InWeb 3.0 tool (www.cbs. dtu.dk/services/VirtualPulldown-1.1b/web/) was used to identify the first-order interacting proteins. Such strategy is based on a neighbor's pull down approach.

As a result, the list of relevant proteins associated with BPF was extended by inclusion of their first-order PPI partners, considering a significant pull down score threshold of 0.25. Biological enrichment of the protein complexes. To identify pathways and toxic effects related to BPF, information on biological pathways were integrated into the protein complex linked to BPF.

Use of MEAs has been proposed as an in vitro neurotoxicity screening method and a recent study demonstrated consistent reproducibility and reliability of MEA measurements across five laboratories. One limitation of MEA approaches is that throughput of this methodology has been low and is limited by the MEA hardware. To date, only one publication has assessed the ability of MEAs to screen a set of twenty environmental chemicals. In this study, activity of chemicals was determined by conducting cumulative concentration-response assessments, which is time-consuming and limits the number of chemicals that can be assessed. A more efficient approach would be to screen compounds at a single concentration to identify those that are ''hits'' and then characterize concentration-responses if desired.

With these backgrounds mentioned above, we have used computational chemistry methods such as homology modeling, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations (MDs) to theoretically predict and analyse the interaction between pyrethroid pesticides and the zebrafish ER α. Then, on this basis we have carried out bio-assay experiments on zebrafish in order to further determine the binding of the molecules and the protein through the different VTG level of their blood, and to lay a foundation for further understanding of the estrogenic activity and the mechanism of action of pyrethroid pesticides. Protein homology modeling is based on the concept of homologous proteins. Generally speaking, when the template protein is with over 60% homology to target protein, the 3D model we derived is accurate. Once the model is generated, the accuracy of the model can be assessed through Ramachandran plots generated by PROCHECK, ERRAT, VERIFY-3D, etc. Since no crystal structure of zebrafish ER α has been reported in the PDB, the 3D structure of zebrafish ER α was obtained through homology modeling."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Type II or non-steroid hormone receptors include thyroid hormone receptor, vitamin D receptor, retinoic acid receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), and others. Between orphan receptors-receptors with an unknown ligand can be found estrogen-related receptors (ERR α, ERR β, ERR γ ). NR signaling pathway consists of specific steps as follows. The ligand penetrates through the cytoplasmic membrane and binds to the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of NR in the cytoplasm or nucleus. Before the ligand binds to the NR, the receptor is coupled with heat-shock proteins (HSPs) in an inactive state. When the ligand binds the receptor, the activation and dimerization of this complex occur. The ligand and receptor without HSPs translocate to the nucleus. They bind to the hormone response elements (HREs), which is a DNA sequence in specific gene promoters. Gene expression starts when coactivators bind to the promoter sequences. 2.4.2. Non-Genomic Action of Steroid Hormones Steroid hormones coupled with NRs can activate cytoplasmic protein kinases associated with various signaling pathways-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), calcium, MAPK, nuclear factor kappa B (NFκ B), and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3k / Akt). In some cases, steroids may bind to membrane receptors, e.g., cytokine receptors, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are not primarily designed for steroid binding."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Accordingly, the objective of our study was to characterize the cytotoxicity of 19 pesticides against RTgill-W1 cells, and also liver (RTL-W1) and gut epithelial (RTgutGC) cell lines, and then to compare the in vitro and in vivo data. Of the 19 pesticides tested, 11, 9, and 8 were cytotoxic to the RTgill-W1, RTL-W1, and RTgutGC cells, respectively. Six pesticides (carbaryl, chlorothalonil, chlorpyrifos, dimethenamid-P, metolachlor, and S-metolachlor) were cytotoxic to all three cell lines. Aminomethylphosphonic acid, chlorantraniliprole, dicamba, diquat, imazethapyr, and permethrin exhibited cell-line-specific toxicity.

By measuring differences across multiple domains, including preference, instrumental escape, and affective-motivational pain behavior, we observed clear evidence for a placebo analgesia-like phenotype in the Conditioned group relative to the unconditioned Control group. Critically, the emergence of the placebo analgesia-like phenotype during the early segment (i.e., 0-90 seconds) of the test session corresponded with both suppression of nociceptive vlPAG MOR neural activity and a rise in released enkephalin. These effects are consistent with reduced availability of MOR receptors seen in human PET imaging scans during the experience of placebo analgesia in humans. Interestingly, we observed putative within-session extinction of the placebo analgesia-like phenotype corresponding with a rise in vlPAG MOR activity, indicative of positive prediction error signaling in vlPAG ( i.e., actual pain experience exceeding expectation). Within these results we found evidence for sex differences in strength of placebo analgesia conditioning. In both preference for the conditioned chamber and nocifensive behavior, male mice exhibited a more rapid transition to extinction-like behavior compared to females. This contrasts with human studies, which have not reached a consensus on the impact of sex on placebo analgesia.

As a result, individual AOPs are often developed as 'linear' constructs, without any converging or diverging pathways connected to them. Therefore, a single AOP may not encompass all events that could contribute to the relevant adverse effect being described. Most toxicologically relevant processes and realworld scenarios would require multiple AOPs to describe and predict given AOs, particularly when concerning mixtures or the multigenerational effects of chemicals. As such, the future utilisation of AOPs for risk assessment would benefit from the development of multiple interacting pathways and networks. While individual AOPs only offer a linear description of biological processes, their merging via common shared KEs and KERs can provide an improved description of the biological complexities inherent to the system studied and, as such, offer additional value. As such, some authors have already begun submitting individual AOPs as networks instead of the typical linear format, e.g. AOP 138. With the development of greater numbers of AOPs, it is inevitable that networks will emerge. These have the potential to consolidate a range of information, previously viewed in isolation, on the potential AOs that may arise from a disturbance of a biological pathway.

Children with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) also benefit from CsA treatment: when Hamasaki et al. prospectively analyzed the 5-year outcomes of children with SRNS who enrolled in their previous prospective multicenter trial on CsA and steroids, they found that CsA treatment greatly improved their renal survival and remission rates. However, many of the children required ongoing immunosuppression. There is some controversy regarding whether CsA is nephrotoxic in patients with SDNS and SRNS. Fujinaga et al. found that two of ten SDNS patients who underwent once-daily CsA therapy developed chronic CsA nephrotoxicity. However, this study lacked a control group. Similarly, however, Fujinaga and Shimizu also found that long-term (2 -3 years) CsA administration in patients with SRNS is an independent risk factor for chronic nephrotoxicity. Moreover, when a patient who developed SRNS at the age of 14 was treated with CsA, her renal function declined and she had to undergo renal transplantation at age 23.

Nephrotoxicity is the most frequent and clinically important complication of CsA use. It is particularly common in renal-transplant patients. CsA-induced apoptosis correlates with the oxidative stress, ER stress, and autophagy that CsA causes. The identification of potential clinical biomarkers of CsA nephrotoxicity is currently a subject of considerable interest because these markers will facilitate the rapid identification of this disease, thereby preventing the development of irreversible damage. Accurate biomarkers will also improve the rational use of CsA. The biomarkers should be involed in the mechanisms of CsA nephrotoxicy. However, the underlying function of the biomarkers in the CsA nephrotoxicity is still poorly understood. Oxidative stress is an important toxic effect of CsA. CsA induces ER stress and subsequently triggers human tubular phenotypic changes and death. Importantly, CsA increases mitochondrial ROS production, which modifies the redox balance and induces lipid peroxidation: this leads to CsA nephrotoxicity. CsA treatment also decreases the antioxidant capacity of the kidney: this may sensitize the kidneys to various stresses, thereby promoting the development of nephrotoxicity. However, the upstream event that reguate the CsA-induced oxidative stress is not fully understood."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"Redox balance modified\""}]}

Unlike ELISA and RIA, one particularly attractive feature of HTRF is the ability to scale the format to 384 or 1536-well microplates for high-throughput screening applications without loss of sensitivity or a need to extract and concentrate the samples. Indeed, the mean basal production of hormones significantly exceeded the LOQ for E2 (0.019 ng/ml) and T (0.1 ng/ml), satisfying the ≥2.5 (E2) and ≥ 5 (T) fold change detection criteria. The concentrations were also higher than cell-free matrix samples exhibiting E2 (0.08 ± 0.04 ng/ml) and T (not detectable) background concentrations in the cell culture medium, confirming de novo synthesis of hormones from the H295R cells in the control samples and sensitivity of the HTRF technology. Cross-reactivity in other immunoassay-based detection systems has been noted for T (not E2) but are not reported by the manufacturer of the HTRF technology. Sampling the cell culture medium for matrix effects in the HTRF assays revealed no detectable T, ruling out confounding effects by additional androgens in the culture medium (e.g., androstenedione) that could cross-react with the antibody-based detection system. Low background concentrations of E2 were evident in the matrix at approximately 6.9-fold below the mean basal concentrations, a level not considered to alter E2 data interpretation."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Consequently, the proteins involved in these pathways may serve as potential mediators of associations between PFAS and cardiometabolic outcomes. Further primary research is needed to fully understand these relationships. Our study did find certain inconsistent associations. Specifically, we observed that the associations of PFHxS, PFHpS, and PFOA with PTPRF were in opposite directions across the two cohorts, showing negative associations in SOLAR and positive associations in Meta-AIR. PTPRF has been shown to modulate beta-catenin signaling and is implicated in insulin signaling and secretion. An increased expression of PTPRF has been found in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in some animal experiments and a human case-control study. Therefore, our findings of negative associations in SOLAR and positive associations in Meta-AIR imply a PFAS-associated insulin resistance, as indicated by PTPRF, decreasing in children, and increasing in young adults. These results suggest that the PFAS association with cardiometabolic outcomes, as supported by existing literature, may involve distinct biological mechanisms and mediation pathways in children compared to adults. However, it is crucial to note that our findings, indicating opposite directions of associations, were not adjusted for multiple comparisons. Hence, caution is warranted in drawing conclusions. This is the first study examining PFAS associations with alterations in high-throughput proteomic profiles relevant to cardiometabolism among Hispanic adolescents and young adults, contributing valuable insights into the potential PFAS mechanistic toxicity at the molecular level."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"PFOA\",\"KE\",\"Altered PTPRF direction across cohorts\"\n\"PFHxS\",\"KE\",\"Altered PTPRF direction across cohorts\"\n\"PFHpS\",\"KE\",\"Altered PTPRF direction across cohorts\"\n\"PFOA\",\"AO\",\"Increased incidence of ulcerative colitis\""}]}

Tubular necrosis, oxidative stress, and cytotoxicity were identified as points of high convergence, each possessing in-degree scores of five. Thus, they were indicated to represent common and significant general features in nephrotoxicity. Conversely, mitochondrial dysfunction was a point of high divergence, having an out-degree score of five, highlighting its importance in the early onset of kidney disease aetiologies. Interestingly, despite being identified as a point of convergence, tubular necrosis had a high number of outgoing KERs, likely due to its association with extensive cell death ahead of acute kidney injury (AKI) and CKD. Similarly, mitochondrial dysfunction possessed a high number of incoming KERs despite being labelled as a divergent KE, thus indicating its crucial role within a variety of nephrotoxic adversities. All MIEs within the network were identified as points of divergence, except glutathione oxidation, which was connected to both an upstream and downstream KE. Glutathione is the main thiol-containing peptide involved in protecting against oxidative stress, and its oxidation can result in an increase in ROS downstream. However, it can also be activated upstream by the binding and activity of other thiol proteins/selenoproteins, such as thioredoxin reductase (https:// aopwi ki. org/ aops/ 284).

While the osteogenic function of GDF2 may seem contradictory to prior epidemiological findings regarding the adverse effects of PFAS on bone health, it's important to understand that GDF2 has a broad range of biological functions. These functions include anti-angiogenesis, involvement in hepatic fibrosis and regeneration, and tumorigenesis. Notably, recent animal experimental work by the Breitkopf-Heinlein team has found that GDF2 is primarily produced by hepatic stellate cells and plays a pro-fibrogenic and pro-inflammatory role upon tissue damage. Elevated levels of GDF2 have been shown to enhance liver damage and fibrogenesis during injuries. Our finding on PFASassociated upregulation of the pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrogenic protein GDF2, aligns with one of our findings of the positive associations of PFAS with several pro-inflammatory proteins, including GDF15 and IL6. These proteins play crucial roles in stress response following injury and tissue regeneration. Besides the above overlapping findings, we identified unique findings in Meta-AIR from IPA, such as the activation of regulation of IGF transport and uptake by IGFBPs associated with PFHxS, PFHpS, and PFAS mixtures, as well as the activation of proliferation of vascular cells associated with PFAS mixtures.

The impact of EDCs such as phthalates on placental function is largely unknown. Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, due to in utero exposures may play a critical role in early programming of disease 11. Epigenetic mechanisms regulate gene expression by determining the accessibility of DNA for transcriptional processing. DNA methylation is due to methyl groups being added to cytosine residues in DNA regions called CpG sites. When methylation occurs in the promoter region it often leads to transcriptional repression but other more distant regulatory elements, enhancers, are also important in regulation of gene expression 12. DNA methylation is important for both placental and embryonic development as loss of de novo DNA methyltransferase isoforms 3A and B can result in impaired placental development and early embryonic death 13. Genomic imprinting is a special case of epigenetic regulation where genes are repressed (imprinted) by methylation according to the parent-of-origin allele. Genomic imprinting is critical in placental biology, as alterations in the expression of these genes have been linked to placental dysfunction, pregnancy complications, and diseases later in life. Emerging evidence suggests that epigenetic regulation of the placental transcriptome is important for regulating placental growth and differentiation. Environmental factors can profoundly alter epigenetic marks, impacting the developing embryo as well as the next generation of offspring. Placental genetic and epigenetic profiles may serve as markers environmental exposures 14-16."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Although it does make sense to prioritize substances with potent and selective effects on network development over those where changes in network function occur concomitantly with changes in viability, nonselective effects should not be dismissed outright. All of the compounds in Figure 4 disrupted network function to some extent; thus inactive compounds are not shown, and the rankings are relative rankings among active compounds. It may be the case for the less potent and/or selective compounds that developing neurons and glia are more susceptible to decreased cell viability than are other tissue types. This hypothesis could be tested by comparison of compound effects on viability in neural versus non-neural cell types. Alternatively, compounds that are nonspecific in the MEA network formation assay may have more specific actions on other key neurodevelopmental processes, such as differentiation or proliferation."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Cypermethrin\",\"KE\",\"Potent and specific disruption of network development\"\n\"Triethyltin bromide\",\"KE\",\"Potent but nonspecific disruption of network development\"\n\"Trimethyltin\",\"KE\",\"Network effects concurrent with viability loss\"\n\"Methotrexate\",\"KE\",\"Network effects concurrent with viability loss\"\n\"Domoic acid\",\"KE\",\"Selective network disruption at lower concentrations than viability effects\"\n\"Haloperidol\",\"KE\",\"Selective network disruption at lower concentrations than viability effects\"\n\"Deltamethrin\",\"KE\",\"Selective network disruption at lower concentrations than viability effects\""}]}

The α3β4 receptor, which is predominant in the peripheral nervous system (PNS), particularly in autonomic ganglia, also follows a heteropentameric organization and plays a key role in peripheral neurotransmission. The homomeric α7 subtype features five AChbinding sites. The α7 nAChR exists in three main functional states: resting, active and desensitized. In the resting state, the channel is closed, and no ionotropic or metabotropic signalling occurs. When a ligand such as acetylcholine (ACh, yellow ball) binds, the receptor transitions to the active state, where the channel opens, permitting ion flow (ionotropic signalling), and metabotropic signalling pathways may also be engaged. In the desensitized state, prolonged ligand binding keeps the channel closed, preventing ionotropic signalling while still allowing metabotropic activity through intracellular signalling cascades.

The consistency of the potency and profile of altered hormone levels supports the reported CYP17A1 mechanism for PRO. The current study included 18 conazoles evaluated in stage III CR, expanding upon the previous knowledge on the effects of conazoles on steroidogenesis. Previous studies have only investigated select conazoles for effects on steroidogenesis, namely PRO, ketoconazole, and imazalil. The evaluation of these conazole fungicides effects on steroidogenesis reveals that the 2 structurally distinguishable conazole classes, imidazole and triazole, can be approximately differentiated from one another based on their distinct profile of effects on steroidogenesis (Figure 3). With the exception of clotrimazole, the imidazoles cluster together due to increases in PROG and/or DOC in addition to strong decreases in COTRISOL, 11DCORT, ANDR, TESTO, ESTRONE, and ESTRADIOL. The triazole fungicides showed more diverse behavior with a generally conserved decrease in CORTISOL levels. Furthermore, most conazoles demonstrate consistent AC50 values across all hormones they concentration-dependently altered supporting the hypothesis that they have a single target mediating their primary effects on steroidogenesis.

We first tested whether the Eya2 N-terminal IDP (aa 40-84), which includes the putative B55-interacting residues 50 FSRSCPRVLPRQ 61, binds directly to PP2A:B55 using pulldown assays. The data show that Eya2 residues 40-84 are sufficient to bind and recruit PP2A:B55 (Fig. 5f). We then generated the Eya3 H79R variant, in which H79 Eya3 was replaced with the equivalent residue in Eya2 (R56 Eya2 ), to test whether an arginine impacts PP2A:B55 recruitment. The data show that the B55 binding was statistically equivalent (Fig. 5g,h); thus, either residue binds the B55 P4 binding pocket effectively. Consistent with this observation, modeling an arginine in this position in the PP2A:B55-Eya3 structure showed that H79R is, like H79, optimally positioned to form both a π -stacking interaction with H179 and a salt bridge with D197 (Extended Data Fig. 9).

This compound is applied in various agricultural and horticultural crops and in households to combat biting and stinging-sucking pests. They act on pests by contact, ingestion, and inhalation, and on the plant surface and inside. Upon entering organisms, CPF inhibits the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), one of the most important enzymes influencing the peripheral and central nervous system in pests. It may also affect the human nervous system in a similar way, contributing to the alteration of normal biochemical and physiological conditions. The application of CPF for agricultural purposes results in its dispersion into various environmental components such as air, soil, surface water (rivers, canals and lakes), and groundwater, disrupting ecosystem functioning. Due to its lipophilicity, CPF has the ability to penetrate the epidermis and enter the animal's body, entering tissues, organs, milk, and other body liquids. In addition, CPF residues have also been detected in fruit, grains, and vegetables. The presence of CPF residues in soils, natural waters, food, and animals and humans is not a new topic, but studies related to the occurrence and biodegradation of this pesticide in different environmental elements and its impact on the ecosystem are the object of research of many researchers even today."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Toxics 2022 10, 701 According to a correlation plot for deltamethrin exposures and behavioral reactions in O. mossambicus, the proportion of mortality, irregular swimming, mucus secretion, and loss of balance were all positively correlated with higher deltamethrin exposures (Figure 5). Oxygen consumption and deltamethrin levels were found to be negatively correlated. Additionally, oxygen consumption revealed a negative correlation with percentage mortality, while irregular swimming, mucus secretion, and loss of balance showed positive correlations. Changes in behavior in the treated O. mossambicus can usually be seen as an early sign of an avoidance response caused by toxicant exposure, narcotic effects, or neurotoxic reactions. A behavioral biomarker is a designator of an early-warning signal for ecotoxicological risk assessment investigations. The fish exposed to deltamethrin most frequently displayed loss of balance, mucus production, and irregular and abnormal swimming patterns. Neurological system impairment is probably what causes lateral swimming and loss of equilibrium. In fish exposed to pesticides, measurements of oxygen as a surrogate for aerobic respiration and metabolic activity revealed decreased oxygen consumption because of potential inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation. The lack of oxygen intake in the mortalities observed at high exposures is implied by the negative connection between mortality and oxygen consumption. 11 of 18 Figure 5.

Genomic Southern blotting was performed to investigate the methylation state in various cell lines. BLT1-expressing cells showed the shorter positive bands by digestion with HpaII, which can cleave only unmethylated CCGG sequences. In contrast, HeLa and HepG2 cells, which do not express BLT1, exhibited the longer digested bands by HpaII. This implies the significant correlation between the expression of BLT1 and the methylation state. Next, we methylated the BLT1 promoter construct p( 2 123/ 1 91) by SssI methylase in vitro, and examined the effect of this methylation on the promoter activity in HeLa cells. The methylated construct showed only 15% promoter activity of the unmethylated construct. These results show that the cell-specific expression of BLT1 is primarily dependent on the methylation of the promoter region. However, EMSA showed that Sp1 binds similarly to methylated and unmethylated DNA probes ( 2 76/ 2 33) in THP-1 and HeLa cells (data not shown). Sp1 is known to bind to the GC box in a methylation-insensitive manner (41). The methylCpG binding proteins, MeCP1 (42) and MeCP2 (43), have been reported to interact specifically with methylated DNA and repress the transcription. These MeCPs might play a role as a repressor in the BLT1 transcription.

Combining MIEs, KEs, and AOs across various AOPs into a unified network offers a more realistic depiction of possible (bio)chemical effects. This approach provides additional insights into interactions between AOPs by presenting specific combinations or sequences of KEs, thus potentially unveiling previously undiscovered or unconsidered connections between biological pathways. In this way, AOP networks enable the visualisation and recognition of features of interest, including those KEs most central and well-connected, the points at which AOPs converge or diverge, and also the presence of positive and negative feedback loops. Furthermore, while the identification of common KEs within AOP networks can facilitate the development of assays that detect adverse effects of regulatory interest, distinctions should also be made when differentiating between generic and disease-specific KEs. A generic KE will be described in a general, abstract manner, and will be applicable either across different AOPs or in multiple instances of a single AOP. While generic KEs capture common biological responses or events across different AOPs, disease-specific KEs focus on the unique characteristics and mechanisms associated with a particular disease or AO.

In this study, results of both in situ detoxification assays and in vitro enzymatic assays demonstrated variation of CYP6P7 and CYP6AA3 activities toward different pyrethroids and with different specificities, suggesting their abilities to metabolize and detoxify several pyrethroid insecticides in An. minimus mosquito. Moreover, ability of CYP6P7 and CYP6AA3 to detoxify pyrethroids observed in this study, although without co-expression of An. minimus cytochrome P450 reductase, indicated that the NADPH-dependent cytochrome P450 reductase enzyme of Sf9 cells could help supporting activity of these mosquito P450s. In conclusion, the results obtained in this study elucidate the ability of CYP6P7 and CYP6AA3 in detoxification of several pyrethroids and emphasize the possible role of CYP6P7 and CYP6AA3 enzymes in conferring pyrethroid resistance in An. minimus mosquito. A correlation of results from MTT cytotoxicity assays and in vitro enzymatic activity assays emphasizes usefulness of employing P450-expressing Sf9 cells to pre-screen detoxification capability of P450s against cytotoxic insecticides using MTT cytotoxicity assays.

These assays do not incorporate measurement of the key events in the toxicity pathways of such neurotoxicants ( e.g. changes in intracellular ion concentrations are secondary events), or are not amenable to collecting data at a rate which can capture the most rapid neurophysiological events, for example disruption of voltage-gated sodium channels and action potential generation by pyrethroid insecticides. By contrast, currently available electrophysiological approaches are not well designed for toxicity screening, as these assays typically consider only one potential target at a time ( e.g. a particular ion channel) and often employ non-neuronal expression systems rather than neuronal tissue. Furthermore, neither biochemical nor HTS physiological ( e.g. patch clamp) approaches consider chemical effects on neuronal network function. Many of these traditional assays were designed as targeted screens for pharmaceutical-lead compound development and lack the ability to detect a broad spectrum of different neurotoxicants. Thus, efficient screening assays that detect neurotoxic or neuroactive chemicals based on changes in function are lacking, particularly those that are sensitive to changes mediated by disruption of a variety of different toxicity pathways. One physiological approach that addresses these limitations is in vitro microelectrode array (MEA) recording. Using MEAs, spontaneous and evoked activity in neuronal networks can be recorded from a variety of different neuronal preparations, including primary cultures, tissue slices and intact retinas."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Lead\",\"MIE\",\"neurotoxic heavy metal\""}]}

In a healthy brain, microglia perform essential functions, such as synaptic pruning and maintenance of neuronal integrity; however, microglial activation is a hallmark of neuroinflammatory processes observed in a spectrum of neurological disorders. In the context of neurodegenerative diseases like AD and PD, excessive microglial activation may contribute significantly to neuronal damage and cognitive deterioration. The continuous release of pro-inflammatory mediators by activated microglia can invoke a vicious cycle of inflammation, exacerbating neural injury and provoking synaptic dysfunction. Furthermore, emerging research has revealed that microglia are implicated in conditions beyond neurodegeneration, including ischemic stroke, where their activation can facilitate acute neuronal death. Given these facts, there is an important need to develop effective and high-throughput methods to detect inflammation-inducing chemicals in neuro-relevant cell models to understand if they can further inform neurotoxicity assessment. Many commonly used in vitro microglia cell lines could not accurately represent the complex in vivo behavior of these cells, particularly concerning tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα ) production in response to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) stimulation. Therefore, selecting an appropriate in vitro microglia model that closely mimics in vivo conditions is critical for developing neuroinflammation detection assays on high-throughput platforms for screening environmental chemicals and other potential neurotoxicants."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Moreover, when rats were treated with CsA, their renal function dropped and their kidneys exhibited tissue peroxidation. Thesefindings together show clearly that ROS plays a pivotal role in CsAinduced renal dysfunction. Co-treatment of rats with CsA, which can induce tissues to produce ROS, significantly reduced CsA-induced oxidative stress while having no effect on CsA-induced nephrotoxicity. Hyperbaric oxygen by itself did not increase renal oxidative stress. This suggests that ROS are involved in CsA nephrotoxicity but are not the direct cause of this toxic activity. Djamali et al. reported recently that NADPH-oxidase 2 is responsible for the CsA-induced increases in oxidative stress. It was thought that Rho-associated kinase may mediate this role of NADPHoxidase 2 because Park et al. found that fasudil, a Rho/Rhokinase inhibitor, ameliorates CsA nephrotoxicity. However, this possibility was challenged recently by El-Yazbi et al.: they found that while the hemodynamic, autonomic, left ventricular and histopathological disturbances of CsA-treated rats are abrogated by inhibiting NADPH-oxidase 2, fasudil had no effect. Fasudil also did not reduce NADPH-oxidase 2 levels. This suggests that CsA exerts its cardiotoxic effects via Rho-associated kinase-independent upregulation of NADPH-oxidase 2."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"Renal function dropped and tissue peroxidation\"\n\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"ROS linked to renal dysfunction\"\n\"CsA\",\"AO\",\"Renal damage after transplantation\""}]}

Thus, they cannot be neatly classified into categories such as ''known neurotoxic'' and are not known to have mechanisms of action relevant to the nervous system. For example, four of these compounds are conazole fungicides that, as discussed above, have been reported to alter calcium homeostasis in neurons in vitro. Thus, activity in MEAs may not be surprising, but there are no other in vitro data to further support this finding, nor are these compounds well-recognized neurotoxiciants. There are several reasons why a compound (for example, the conazoles) may be active in the MEA assay, yet inactive in vivo. The in vitro MEA assay lacks significant metabolic capacity and a blood-brain barrier, both of which may prevent a compound from disrupting neuronal function following exposure in vivo. Another example of the difficulty in classifying these compounds are the three androgen receptor active compounds in this group. There were not sufficient data in the literature for any one of these three compounds to be confident that it should be neuroactive in vitro and/or neuroactive/ neurotoxic in vivo.

Further support for the connection between DEHP exposure and E2 biosynthesis was provided by the KEGG analysis of DEHP-affected genes in which the estrogen biosynthetic process was identified as the key BP affected by DEHP exposure. Since DEHP is mapped to a divergent KE 'Reduced E2 in circulation', it can further branch its effect into two different AOs: (i) it can either lead to the AO 'Impaired fertility' through a direct action on the ovaries, thus causing irregularities of the ovarian cycle, or (ii) it can act on the hypothalamus-hypophysis axis by decreasing the GnRH and LH release, thereby reducing the number of ovulated oocytes.

The closest concentration to the recommended 1 µM was 2.1 µM; a concentration within the 1-3 µM range used in the OECD validation study that was not likely to result in significantly different outcomes. Inhibition of T levels by prochloraz (supplementary fig. 2B) was consistent with expectations 75% of the time. Inhibition of E2 demonstrated an appropriate downward trend but did not meet the recommended threshold of ≤0.5 fold change of solvent control for any plate (supplementary fig. 2A). Low basal E2 synthesis has been reported in the H295R cell line. Minimal E2 synthesis yielded a dynamic range that was fairly insensitive to identifying loss-of-function effects and possibly weakened the ability to accurately detect changes in the assay. Indeed, meeting the fold change threshold for E2 inhibition by prochloraz has been a noted limitation for some laboratories. To overcome this challenge, the HT-H295R assay format implemented a priming period whereby steroidogenic enzyme expression was induced with forskolin prior to plating for test chemical treatments. This approach enhanced the dynamic range of E2 to likely enable greater sensitivity for identifying inhibitory effects but may have suppressed the ability to identify inducers. A parallel effort was made in this study to enhance the dynamic range for E2 and T by co-exposing the cells to 10 µM forskolin with test chemical treatment (supplementary tables 3, 4)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Forskolin\",\"KE\",\"stimulates steroidogenic enzyme expression\"\n\"Prochloraz\",\"KE\",\"decreased 17β-estradiol (E2) biosynthesis (downward trend; threshold issue noted)\""}]}

Therefore, further analytical evaluation of zebrafish embryos exposed to E-CBZ and IM could help further understand the pathway. If 9ACA, AI, and AO are formed out of E-CBZ and/or IM, the second pathway CBZ > E-CBZ/IM > 9ACA > AI > AO (potentially in combination with the first pathway) is followed. Anyway, we showed that the MPO homologue, responsible for the metabolization of CBZ into 9ACA, AI and AO is already active at 24 hpf. This finding is also interesting for other drugs that are biotransformed by MPOs, including arylamides such as diclofenac and clozapine. As 9ACA is detected in larvae exposed to CBZ, and AI and AO are detected in larvae exposed to 9ACA, all three metabolites could be responsible for the teratogenic effects observed after exposure to CBZ. This is strengthened by the fact that our morphological evaluation indicated similar anomalies by the parent and (some of) the metabolites. An obvious example is the edema around the eyes that was detected in larvae exposed to 250 µ M CBZ and in larvae exposed to 30 µ M AI."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Thus, the long-term use of CsA in IgAN patients may not be indicated. Interestingly, the study also found that the CsA-induced increase in interstitialfibrosis did not associate with increased osteopontin production and macrophage numbers in the kidney. Although the CsA nephrotoxicity is correlated with the duration of CsA treatment in pediatric patient, Hamasaki et al. recently found that most of cases of CsA nephrotoxicity involved arteriolar hyalinosis, suggesting that long-term CsA treatment is useful for treatment of frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome. Osteopontin is produced by various immune cells and acts as a chemoattractant for macrophages. Wirestam et al. recently reported that patients with systemic lupus erythmatosis, which is an autoimmune disease that often associates with kidneyfibrosis, have high circulating levels of osteopontin. This molecule may promote inflammatory damage to the kidney, which in turn induces interstitialfibrosis. Thesefindings could suggest that osteopontin may also participate in renal interstitialfi-brosis that is induced by CsA.

Westerink 1 Neurotoxicology Research Group, Toxicology Division, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences (IRAS), Utrecht University, NL-3508 TD Utrecht, The Netherlands Wepreviously demonstrated that acute inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) is a common mode of action for (sub)micromolar concentrations of chemicals, including insecticides. However, because human exposure to chemicals is usually chronic and repeated, we investigated if selected insecticides from different chemical classes (organochlorines, organophosphates, pyrethroids, carbamates, and neonicotinoids) also disturb calcium homeostasis after subchronic (24h) exposure and after a subsequent (repeated) acute exposure. Effects on calcium homeostasis were investigated with singlecell fluorescence (Fura-2) imaging of PC12 cells. Cells were depolarized with high-K saline to study effects of subchronic or repeated exposure on VGCC-mediated Ca influx. The results demonstrate that except for carbaryl and imidacloprid, all selected insecticides inhibited depolarization (K )-evoked Ca influx after subchronic exposure (IC 's: approximately 1-10 m M) in PC12 cells. These inhibitory effects were not or only slowly reversible. Moreover, repeated exposure augmented the inhibition of the K -evoked increase in intracellular calcium concentration induced by subchronic exposure to cypermethrin, chlorpyrifos, chlorpyrifos-oxon, and endosulfan (IC 's: approximately 0.1-4 m M).

The sustainable development goal report articulated the need to improve the understanding of current practices and drivers of pesticide and fertilizer use, and identify knowledge gaps regarding environmental and health risks. Due to current management practices, legislation, and policies to minimize adverse environmental and health impacts, SDGs specify that the environmental footprint of crop protection should be minimized. Pyrethroid insecticides are preferred over organochlorine and organophosphate insecticides due to their powerful insecticidal properties and low toxicity to most non-target animals, particularly mammals. However, some are highly harmful to all aquatic creatures. In particular, fish are the most vulnerable class of nontarget aquatic species due to their enzyme-system deficiency in hydrolyzing pyrethroids. Although the larvicidal regimen of pyrethroids in aquatic systems increases risks and potential hazards to fish, deltamethrin, one of the most commonly used, has been linked to a wide number of stress-related outcomes in fish. Classed as a moderately toxic substance (WHO Class II), deltamethrin induces neurotoxicity in insects and imminent death via paralysis by modifying the kinetics of voltagesensitive sodium channels and increasing nerve membrane sodium permeability. The greater susceptibility of fish to its effects compared to other endotherms, such as birds and mammals, is attributable in part to their lower metabolic rate and inefficient pesticide metabolic breakdown."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"deltamethrin\",\"MIE\",\"Impairment of voltage-gated sodium channels and inhibition of ATPase enzymes\"\n\"deltamethrin\",\"KE\",\"Decrease production of energy (AOP)\"\n\"deltamethrin\",\"MIE\",\"Voltage-gated sodium channel kinetic alteration / increased Na+ permeability\"\n\"deltamethrin\",\"MIE\",\"Enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (AOP)\"\n\"deltamethrin\",\"KE\",\"Suppression of AChE hydrolyzing activity (AOP)\""}]}

Carbamates are considered reversible AChE inhibitors and OPs as irreversible AChE inhibitors. OPs are able to phosphorylate serine residues of AChE in non-reversible way, whereas the carbamylated serine residue is less stable and the carbamyl moiety can be split from the enzyme by spontaneous hydrolysis. We have earlier reported antagonistic effects of the binary combination of OPs (CPF + PRF, CPF + MLT, MCP + MLT, PRF + MLT, MLT + TRZ and PRF + TRZ) under oxidised conditions. This was explained on the basis of dispositional and/ or receptor antagonism. We also reported synergistic responses for the majority of the OP binary combinations assayed under unoxidised conditions. Triazophos showed very strong synergism in binary combinations with CPF, MCP and PRF under un-oxidised conditions. In the present study, TRZ showed synergistic effects with CBF and CRB. Laetz et al. observed both concentration additivity and synergism in the binary combinations of carbamates and organophosphates tested, with a greater degree of synergism at higher exposure concentrations. However, the comparison between in vivo and in vitro results should be used with caution and care should be taken when extrapolating among taxonomic groups.

If the number of assays screened as positive was less than 5, a default value of 1000 µM was assigned due to lack of evidence to support a cytotoxic concentration. This last behavior is indicative of generalized cell stress-related assay interference. Cytotoxicitybased interference is characterized by a Z-score which measures where specific activity occurs relative to cytotoxic concentrations. A large Z-score (>3) indicates that specific activity occurs well below the cytotoxic level. The revised schema for the CS is given in Table 2. These weightings were somewhat arbitrary but were meant to emphasize what the authors felt were the most important factors for distinguishing true from false positive antagonist signals. The overall CS is the sum of the individual contributions, and the higher the score, the more confident one can be that the observed activity is due to antagonist activity rather than assay interference. Values can range from +7 to -4. The subset models are calculated using exactly the same method and software as the full model but using only a subset of the assays.

Thus, we evaluated respiratory distress and behavioral alterations in Oreochromis mossambicus under acute deltamethrin exposure regimes. To unravel mechanistic possibilities and affinities with biomolecules, the chemical structure of single chemicals has been subjected to extensive computational investigations and homology modeling. These in silico (computational simulation or modeling) methods are useful in indicating the presence or absence of a toxic property. More reports have indicated that these models could complement or eventually replace animal testing. Furthermore, to provide information and visualize possible mechanistic pathways for deltamethrin toxicity to fish respiration and behavior, we attempted to develop the Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) framework using evidence-based information. Aside from seeking to establish the median 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, and 10% hazardous concentrations (LC, LC, LC, LC, and LC ), this study specifically aimed to evaluate the acute toxicity of deltamethrin to Mozambique tilapia, Oreochromis mossambicus, using respiratory distress and behavioral toxicity as endpoints.

The scripts used for the analysis of tipping points are available at the following doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.23719/1407690. First, the z-scores of the nine normalized network parameters (MFR, #AE, BR, #ABE, % SiB, #NS, %SiNS, r and MI) from each well were used to represent the system perturbation at DIV 5, 7, 9, and 12 (denoted as X, X, X, and X, respectively) for each treatment replicate. Second, total scalar perturbation values (| X |, | X |, | X |, and | X |) were calculated from the system perturbation as the Euclidean norm. This resulted in strictly positive values representative of the total number of standard deviations away from ' normal ' network recordings at each time point. The difference between scalar perturbation values at DIV 5, 7, or 9 and the terminal DIV 12 value were divided by the number of days elapsed to calculate a numerical derivative of change in scalar perturbation over change in time (denoted as V, V, V, and V ). These values were termed ' velocities ' of the system and plotted as individual well velocities over increasing concentration of compound. The velocity over concentration relationship for all replicates was approximated with a localized regression function. The derivative of the velocity with respect to concentration (denoted as ∂ V ) for each compound was then taken to search for a critical concentration at which the slope of velocity changes from negative to positive."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

First, they found that it failed to inhibit the ROS generation induced by GOX, which indicates that CsA does not serve as an antioxidant. However, CsA treatment did block the translocation of p53 to the mitochondria, thereby inhibiting the mitochondrial permeability transition and suppressing ROS-mediated cell apoptosis. The possibility that CsA can protect against apoptosis is supported by the recent study of Baky et al. When they subjected rat pups to a closed head injury and then treated them with CsA, it significantly reduced not only the lipid peroxidation and inflammation in the brain but also the levels of the brain apoptotic biomarkers. In summary, oxidative stress is an important effect of exposure of CsA. Like toxic agents such as mycotoxins, CsA induces ER stress activity and subsequently triggers phenotypic changes and death in tubular cells, thereby inducing nephrotoxicity. Significantly, CsA increases mitochrondrial ROS production, alters the redox balance, and induces lipid peroxidation: these effects promote CsA nephrotoxicity. However, recent studies show that CsA-induced ROS production itself is not the direct cause of this toxicity. CsA also damages the mitochondria, reduces the mitochondrial ΔΨ m, and increases mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening, thereby inducing renal cell apoptosis and nephrotoxicity. CsA treatment decreases the antioxidant capacity of the kidney, which sensitizes the kidney to various stresses and thus promotes nephrotoxicity. Oxidative stress is a major factor of CsA nephrotoxicity."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"Lipid peroxidation\"\n\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"Total antioxidant capacity in kidney dropped\"\n\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"Osteopontin production linked to inflammation\"\n\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"Lipid peroxides driven by endothelin-1/TGF-β1 and COX-2 changes\""}]}

Though margin strategy achieved the highest MCC of 0.293, entropy's competitive 0.273 score, combined with superior AUROC (0.718) and AUPRC (0.711) results, underscored its robustness. Note that the uncertainty strategy remained the weakest across all metrics as demonstrated in the blue line in Figure 6B -D. This analysis highlights entropy strategy as the most effective for maintaining high classification reliability utilizing single learner AL, with margin strategy as a second alternative and uncertainty strategy lagging behind. However, the single learner AL demonstrated low performance in the MCC metric. To address this, we employed an innovative approach that leverages active stacking-deep learning combined with strategic sampling to enhance the model's reliability in predicting compounds. 3.5. Active Stacking-Deep Learning with Strategic Sampling Performance. We further analyzed our most representative initial data set using a strategic sampling of six subsets derived from the ratio of active-to-inactive classes.

After setting the fiber optic in position, MetaBond (Parkell) and Jet Set dental acrylic (Lang Dental) were applied to the skull of the mouse to rapidly and firmly fix the fiberoptic in place. Prior to cementing, the exposed skull bone was scored with a scalpel blade and two small screw (~1.7 mm diameter, 1.6 mm length) were partially threaded into the skull to provide adhesion points for the MetaBond.

Moreover, a contactin-1 knock-down-dependent increase in RhoA activity caused morphological alterations in rat cortical neurons in vivo. Neurite outgrowth is further regulated by protein kinase C (PKC), a serine/threonine kinase, which controls various cellular responses by phosphorylation of substrate molecules and alteration of gene transcription. While PKC activation induced neurite outgrowth in rat pheochromocytoma (PC-12) cells and primary rat spinal cord neurons from embryonic day 14, inhibition of PKC with the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide 1 (Bis-I) reduced neurite growth in PC-12 cells, rat cortical neurons and human iPSCderived neurons. Similar effects were identified in the NPC4 assay upon exposure of hNPCs to Bis-I, which reduced neurite length and area compared to the solvent control ( Figure 4J adapted from Masjosthusmann et al. ).

In total, 334 target genes associated with ASD and DEHP, and 888 target genes associated with ASD and BPA were identified (Table 1). 3.2. Target phenotypes connecting DEHP or BPA to ASD Based on the collected target genes, the phenotypes associated with chemicals and diseases were then analyzed. By searching the databases for phenotypes associated with chemicals and diseases, we initially compiled 104 phenotypes related to DEHP and 285 phenotypes related to BPA (both from CTD) (Table 2). For ASD-related phenotypes, a total of 1350 phenotypes (1275 from CTD and 129 from MalaCards) were collected. We then performed GO and Pathway analyses on these target phenotypes and found 1241 and 1440 phenotypes, respectively (Table 2). Finally, we identified 137 target phenotypes associated with ASDandDEHP,and187target phenotypes associated with ASD and BPA (Table 2). 3.3.

This reshaping involved adding a time step dimension of one to the original twodimensional (2D) feature matrix, allowing the model to process each sample as a sequence of length one with multiple features. The architecture included two BiLSTM layers, each with 128 units and set to return sequences, allowing the model to capture bidirectional patterns in the data. To mitigate overfitting, a dropout layer with a 0.3 rate was added after the BiLSTM layers. This was followed by two dense layers with 128 and 64 neurons, respectively, both using the ReLU activation function to refine the data processing. The model concluded with an output layer featuring a single neuron activated by a sigmoid function, ideal for binary classification tasks. 2.3.3. Attention Architecture. The attention network is composed of three layers. First, a dense layer with 64 neurons and ReLU activation transforms the input data into a format that facilitates effective feature extraction; its output is reshaped to feed into the attention layer. Next, the attention layer processes queries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. Queries are represented by matrix Q, while keys and values are stored in matrices K and V, respectively. The attention mechanism computes the dot product between the query and the transpose of the keys, scales the result by d, and applies the softmax function to produce weights for the values."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

This density was attributed to p107 (residues 615-635) or Eya3 (residues 72-84). Although they bind the same surface of B55, they do so in distinct conformations, with p107 forming a helix and Eya3 binding in an extended conformation (Fig. 3e). p107 binds B55 as a helix, with the residues N-terminal to the helix binding the B55 wall and those C-terminal extending toward the PP2Ac catalytic site (Fig. 4a). The interaction of the p107 N terminus ( 615 SPLMHP 620 ) with the B55 wall is anchored by L617 p107, which binds B55 hydrophobic pocket P7 (F280B55, F281 B55, I284 B55, Y337 B55 and F343 B55; Fig. 4b), and H619 which binds B55 hydrophobic/polar pocket P8 (S247 B55, E283 B55, I284B55, S287 B55, F343 B55 and K345 B55; Fig. 4c).

Typical representatives are diclofenac (DCF) and triclosan (TCS). Acute toxicity of these substances was experimentally assessed using the freshwater algae Raphidocelis subcapitata (living, immobilized). The IC50 achieved for R. subcapitata was 177.7-189.1 mg · L -1 for DCF and 5.4-17.2 µ g · L -1 for TCS, whereas, regarding DCF, the results corresponded to the values observed by other authors. Concerning TCS, the results were lower than predicted and indicated TCSs' higher toxicity. The immobilized R. subcapitata showed comparable results with its living culture for DCF only. Regarding K2Cr2O7 and TCS, the immobilized alga was more sensitive. The DCF and TCF removal from water was tested by sorption, photocatalytic and photolytic processes. TiO2 was used as a photocatalyst. Norit and SuperSorbon were used as sorbents based on activated charcoal.

These results indicate that in the presence of ongoing inflammation, which can be caused by, for example, even a common cold, additional exposure to organophosphate may result in increased disease intensity, which may increase the risk of developing chronic inflammatory diseases such as asthma and COPD. 3.3.3. Exposure to CPF in Humans by Dermal Absorption Adverse effects from the consumption of sub-toxic doses of CPF by both oral admission and inhalation have been proven in many studies. However, there is still a general perception that skin exposure to CPF is not as dangerous or as relevant as other routes of exposure. Therefore, especially in developing countries, both farmers and others involved in the production, transport, sale, and use of pesticides have not paid sufficient attention to skin exposure to CPF. This compound is absorbed through the skin, which may result in systemic poisoning. There is evidence that CPF and its metabolites accumulate in the skin, prolonging the exposure time and causing even more adverse long-term effects. The efficiency of CPF absorption through the skin tends to be lower and the absorption rate is slower compared to other routes of exposure and depends on the solvent used."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Chlorpyrifos\",\"KE\",\"Increased IL-6 promoter induction in bronchial epithelial cells\"\n\"Chlorpyrifos\",\"KE\",\"Increased TNFα promoter induction in bronchial epithelial cells\"\n\"Chlorpyrifos\",\"AO\",\"Systemic poisoning via dermal absorption\"\n\"Chlorpyrifos\",\"KE\",\"Accumulation in skin prolongs exposure\"\n\"Chlorpyrifos\",\"KE\",\"Increased MCP-1\"\n\"Chlorpyrifos\",\"KE\",\"Increased GFAP mRNA\"\n\"Chlorpyrifos\",\"KE\",\"Increased gastric inhibitory polypeptide\""}]}

After midpoint determination of stage-specific activity peaks (stars, Fig. 1C), the change in spontaneous locomotor activity was the difference between the control and exposed peak heights for each stage, and the delay was the difference in mid-peak time (dotted straight lines, Fig. 1C), normalized to plate-matched control values. For continuous exposures of 5-fluorouracil (5FU), dose-responsive developmental delays ranged from 6 % to 45 % at 1 -5 µ g/mL (Fig. 2 A). Note that in two of four independent experiments, activity curves for the 4 µ g/mL 5FU cohorts at L2 and the 5 µ g/mL 5FU cohorts for L4 were not clear enough to determine a peak time or height (example, Fig. 1B) and were therefore marked with an '2/4 ' in Fig. 2.

Algae R. subcapitata appeared to be the most sensitive test species for TCS. Regarding treatment processes, the tertiary treatment approaches have often been proposed to decompose the pharmaceutically active compounds in wastewater. The choice of technology depends on a number of objective factors, such as the type of water and its amount, the load of pathogens, the input composition and the concentration of pharmaceutical and personal care products, including all accompanying pollutants. There are plenty of interesting technological practices already being applied, and even those which could be applied, to all types of water in general (chlorination, ozonation, bioremediation, membrane separation, electrochemical methods, advanced oxidation processes, etc.); however, their scale-up is difficult. A number of hybrid combinations of UV/oxidants, e.g., UV/TiO + UV/H O + UV/persuphates + UV/Fenton + O, which may significantly reduce EDs, exist; nevertheless, these have, so far, been more interesting in terms of scientific knowledge, especially regarding the economic point of view. The literature abounds in hundreds of sophisticated procedures; unfortunately, they are realistically feasible only in the laboratory scale. The use of ultraviolet (UV) radiation, similar to photocatalysis, is effective and reduces pollutant concentrations; however, it can also produce a number of toxic by-products.

The primary targets of the phthalates' action on the testis are Sertoli cells and Leydig cells. In vitro studies demonstrated that DEHP exposure at 40, 80 and 160 µ Mand dibutyl phthalate (DBP) exposure at 10 and 100 mg / L caused the apoptosis of TM3 Leydig cells and Sertoli cells of Male Sprague-Dawley rats, respectively. Animal studies showed that prenatal exposure to DiNP at 100 mg / kg resulted in multinucleated gonocytes among male Sprague-Dawley rats; prenatal exposure to DBP at 500 mg / kg was linked with malformed seminiferous tubules among male Wistar rats; prenatal exposure to dicyclohexyl phthalate (DCHP) was associated with multinucleated gonocytes (at 100 and 500 mg / kg), focal testis dysgenesis (at 500 mg / kg), abnormal Leydig cells morphology and abnormal aggregation (at 10, 100, 500 mg / kg). Postnatal DBP exposure at 200, 400 and 600 mg / kg induced seminiferous cords necrosis and the absence of spermatogenesis in rats. Phthalate exposure induced the impairment of sperm parameters in men. The level of mono-iso-nonyl phthalate (MiBP) was positively associated with sperm motility and negatively associated with total sperm count."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"phthalates\",\"AO\",\"Spermatogenesis impairment\""}]}

The second was to compare the median of the 9 AUC-derived EC values to the critical concentration for each compound. Both values are shown in relation to the tipping point concentration in Fig. 5B. For the majority of compounds (27/42, 64.3%), the tipping point concentration was equal to or lower than the minimum AUCderived EC values identified. For all but four compounds (emamectin benzoate, mevastatin, PBDE-47, and diazepam), the critical concentration was below the median AUC-derived EC values. This result suggests that in most cases, tipping points serve as a more sensitive measure of network developmental effects than looking for individual network parameter changes. Interestingly, in the cases where the minimum AUC-derived EC values fell below the critical concentration, 9 out of 15 times it was the number of network spikes parameter that produced the lowest EC. The number of network spikes may therefore be considered the most sensitive of the 9 parameters examined. 3.4.

Its widespread use in houses exposed residents to this agent by inhalation. Therefore, based on a decision by US EPA, CPF was almost completely eliminated from sales to the public. The literature data indicate that CPF is considered as a compound that easily penetrates the lungs after being sprayed in the air, although studies on humans and rats do not fully confirm this observation. The study by Garabrant et al. compared employees who had direct contact with CPF during the production process with people who were not exposed to it. There were no differences in the occurrence of central and peripheral nervous system symptoms in both groups. In addition, although the studies on rats showed that exposure to high doses of CPF in the air may cause inhibition of cholinesterase, the rate of absorption or the bioavailability of this compound from air is not fully understood. Therefore, it seems unlikely that concentrations of CPF in the air of less than 10 µ g/m 3 could cause inhibition of erythrocyte AChE activities or plasma butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) in humans. Regarding the in vitro studies of CPF in human cell lines representative of the respiratory system, evidence for the cytotoxic activity of pesticides is accessible.

Several pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and cosmetic companies are currently using the zebrafish embryo as an alternative for animal testing to screen new compounds for developmental toxicity. Zebrafish embryo-based assays, such as the ZEDTA, are a promising alternative as morphological effects of xenobiotics can be assessed in a whole vertebrate organism during the main organogenesis period, which is in contrast to other alterative assays, such as the limb bud micromass test (MM), the rat whole embryo culture (WEC) and the mouse embryonic stem cell test (EST). After all, the EST and MM do not allow assessment in a whole organism, while the WEC only allows assessment during a short period of the organogenesis period (i.e., only for 24 -48 h). Moreover, using zebrafish embryo assays as a screening tool confers various other advantages as well. Zebrafish are cost-effective and need only a small amount of test compound due to the small size of the embryos."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Only four compounds caused measurable cytotoxicity, indicating that for most of the compounds tested, activity was selectively affected during the exposure. Thus, this assay has a sensitivity, specificity, and concordance of 87, 100 and 90%, respectively. These results indicate that a single concentration screening approach can be used to detect chemicals with the potential to alter neuronal function; such ''hits'' could then be confirmed with concentrationresponse assessments. Using such an approach in mwMEA plates can significantly increase the throughput of MEAs for neurotoxicity testing. The basic aspects (ontogeny, pharmacological sensitivity) of spontaneous activity of cortical neuronal networks remain consistent across a number of MEA platforms and laboratories. In the present experiments, the ontogeny of spontaneous activity was consistent with previous results, as was the pharmacology. TTX, which blocks voltage-gated sodium channels, blocked all activity. Bicuculline-induced increases in activity occurred with an EC value similar to that which had been historically observed in the laboratory. In some cases, BIC did not result in overall increases in network activity. This has been observed in our laboratory (unpublished data) and heterogeneous responses in other laboratories have also been reported."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

The third pathway of DEHP in the HFRT-AOP network encompasses two KEs that belong to different subnetworks: 'Reduced ovarian E2' and 'Apoptosis'. This pathway of DEHP-induced human female reproductive toxicity is depicted in the study of Tripathi et al. and involves ROS and oxidative stress formation, which decrease the expression of aromatase and reduce E2 production in the ovary leading to apoptosis in DEHP-exposed granulosa cells. Although this DEHP action could be a part of the above-explained pathways by which this ED affects the female reproductive system, we have decided to segregate it for the reasons described below. First, it provides a new experimentally determined connection between two KEs in different subnetworks: reduction of E2 in the ovary and apoptosis. A new connection established in the AOP network has the potential to reveal unknown relationships between distant KEs and may represent toxicity pathways specific to EDs. It may also lead to the prediction of unknown adverse effects upon specific ED exposure, as well as guide future development of new AOPs. Such a new path, called an emergent path, can also lead to development of new stand-alone AOPs. Therefore, the new connection established in the HFRT-AOP network may represent an emergent path in DEHP-induced female reproductive dysfunction."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"DEHP\",\"KE\",\"Reduced E2 production leading to apoptosis in granulosa cells\"\n\"DEHP\",\"MIE\",\"Oxidative stress as potential MIE\"\n\"DEHP\",\"KE\",\"ROS/oxidative stress decreases aromatase expression\"\n\"DEHP\",\"KE\",\"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) / oxidative stress detected\""}]}

Antimicrobial properties of enamino carbonyl compounds Antimicrobial resistance among microbial pathogens has become a major health crisis around the globe. Hence, research towards the synthesis and characterization of novel compounds with antimicrobial activities is ongoing, which might provide a better tool (compound) to combat the antimicrobial resistance problem. Meanwhile, the community acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CAMRSA), hospital-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus (HAMRSA), Campylobacter jejuni, and Candida albicans are some common human pathogens found in clinical settings and retail food products. Reports of these microbes with multidrug resistance (antibacterial or antifungal) have indicated the health system's challenges for effective clinical treatment. So, this study was designed to investigate the biological activity of enamino carbonyl compounds presented in this paper and reported earlier by us elsewhere (Table S6 † ) against those common microbial pathogens. Among the screened enamino carbonyl compounds (total of 45, Table S6 † ), eleven compounds showed antimicrobial activity against one or more tested pathogens (Table S7 † ). None of the enamino carbonyl compounds synthesized in the current study showed antimicrobial activity. Six compounds could inhibit the growth of all tested pathogens (Fig."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"screened enamino carbonyl compounds\",\"AO\",\"Antimicrobial activity in subset\"\n\"enamino carbonyl compounds synthesized in the current study\",\"AO\",\"No antimicrobial activity observed\"\n\"ketoconazole\",\"MIE\",\"Potent CYP3A4 inhibitor (positive control)\""}]}

Due to a large amount of probes tested (834,015) and small sample size, we considered a nominal p-value of 0.005 as significant in both the DMP and DMR analysis. Enrichment analysis using gene symbols from the candidate DMPs and probes present in DMRs (nominal p-value < 0.005) was performed in Panther (Version 11.1) to identify key pathways (Panther Pathways v 3.4.1) and biological processes (Gene ontology, GO database version 1.2).

Therefore, altered blood-based Αβ levels may contribute to brain-heart cross-talk serving as a common surrogate biomarker of neuro-CVDs. 12,15,101,102 Further experimental and clinical studies are needed to elucidate the interrelated mechanisms between A β metabolism, cognitive performance, and CVD. Cardiovascular treatment may affect cognitive functions in humans indicating the presence of a link between CV health and brain health. Cardiovascular drugs used in routine clinical practice, such as statins, antihypertensives, beta-blockers, and diuretics, may intervene in A β metabolism by modulating its production, secretion, and clearance, affecting A β circulating levels. Experimental and a limited number of clinical studies indicate that some of these drugs exert A β 40-lowering action, thus suggesting off-target benefits beyond their known mechanistic actions in CVD. In addition to that hypothesis, A β 40 metabolism at several levels has been tested as a potential therapeutic target in AD by developing different types of novel pharmaceutical agents.

Therefore, the development of innovative computing methodologies that allow the prioritization of chemicals according to their inferred threats is highly relevant both for the research community and for health agencies. Such in silico methods that use available data sources also can accelerate the description of new AOPs and provide integrated data to increase the information content of existing AOPs. The breadth of the currently available scientific literature and diversity of synonyms for chemicals complicates meaningful integration of the information.

They expand on how observed alterations in kidney biomarkers for individuals who have been overexposed to uranium may be attributed to tubular necrosis, which was deemed the most significant clinical outcome of acute exposure in humans. By considering taxonomic applicability during development, researchers may ensure that an AOP can be used with confidence to predict potential adverse effects across different species. If an AOP is only applicable across a narrow range of taxa, then it may be necessary to conduct additional studies to fill data gaps within other species. However, the approach utilised for the development of this AOP network helped to provide a means to compare the results of two distinct AOPs, thus simultaneously enabling the identification of similarities in nephrotoxic responses, while preserving the species-specific findings for each. AOPs should be chemical-agnostic since they aim to provide a general framework for understanding the biological pathways and potential AOs associated with a MIE and its downstream effects, regardless of the specific chemical involved.

Determination of the amount of complex formed through spectrofluorimetry at 470/525 nm. Compounds were screened at 10 m M. We focused on two therapeutic targets, ADORA2A and PDE4D, associated with bronchial asthma. It is an allergic reaction to inhaled allergens that causes airflow obstruction, bronchial hyper-responsiveness, and airway inflammation. 88 Bronchial asthma is currently alleviated using two types of bronchodilators: b stimulants and anticholinergics. ADRB2 increases the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels and relaxes the bronchial smooth muscle. Anticholinergic drugs increase the intracellular Ca + concentration and inhibit bronchial smooth muscle contraction by inhibiting binding to CHRM3. However, long-term use of b stimulants increases the risk of arrhythmia and cardiac arrest, whereas anticholinergic drugs have a slow activity onset and weak action. Therefore, targeting ADORA2A and PDE4D associated with bronchodilation might be more effective than targeting ADRB2 or CHRM3 alone."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

It was concluded that the toxicities of bifenthrin, cypermethrin and deltamethrin in the resistant population of houseflies could be enhanced by the combination with chlorpyrifos, profenofos, emamectin andfipronil. Earlier investigations have proposed that OPs, when used in combination with SPs, inhibit the enzymes (monooxygenases and/or esterases) responsible for metabolic detoxification in different insect pests. In the present study under in vitro conditions, we have used pure housefly-head AChE with no A-esterase, CES and BChE enzyme activity. Therefore these other enzymes are not producing the observed deviations from concentration-addition in the binary combinations between OPs, CBs and SPs. However, A-esterases, CES and BChE were not tested in the present study. This should be further investigated in the future studies. In the present study, the EC and EC values of AChE inhibition for CPF, TRZ, MCP and MLT in combination with DLT or CYP did not increase with the increase in PYR concentrations (0.1 and 10 m g/L). We hypothesise that the binary mixture results of OPs and SPs were influenced mainly by the OP component of the mixture. Although attempts to account for mixtures have been made, these have generally assumed that the toxicity of the mixture conforms to the CA mode of joint action."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"chlorpyrifos\",\"MIE\",\"AChE inhibition\"\n\"profenofos\",\"MIE\",\"AChE inhibition\"\n\"cypermethrin\",\"KE\",\"no AChE inhibition alone\"\n\"deltamethrin\",\"KE\",\"no AChE inhibition alone\"\n\"profenofos\",\"KE\",\"no change with oxidation\"\n\"cypermethrin\",\"KE\",\"high synergism with OPs\""}]}

Additionally, we communicate preliminary pharmacokinetic data on indolizidine ( /C0 )-237D. As enamino carbonyl compounds are known for therapeutic properties, we asked ourselves do our enamino carbonyl compounds also possess bioactivity? Therefore, we conducted antibacterial, antimicrobial, and antifungal screening of previously reported and new enamino carbonyl compounds. We share these  ndings here as well. To prepare trisubstituted enamino carbonyl compounds, we initially investigated multiple catalysts for the coupling of thioamides and diazo compounds with a single electronwithdrawing substituent that serves as a precursor to acceptor-substituted carbenoids. Then, we attempted the similar reaction conditions we have previously found to be successful in coupling donor/acceptor diazo compounds and thioamides. Weused these conditions to couple 3a and 4a and compared the results with other catalysts (Table 1) and other reaction conditions. We selected this coupling reaction as debenzylation of 5a could give 1 that we needed for synthesizing indolizidine ( /C0 )-237D analogs. We started the screening reaction of 3a with 4a using 5 mol% of CuBr at 40 C. 1 H NMR of crude reaction mixture showed 78% conversion (Table 1, entry 1) a  er 24 h. When the catalyst amount was increased to 10 mol%, it increased the conversion to 89% (Table 1, entry 2)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Another crucial key neurodevelopmental process represented within the DNT IVB is the formation and function of neural networks, since nervous system development requires functional networks consisting of different types of neurons and glial cells. Furthermore, certain brain disorders, like autism spectrum disorder, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, are associated with dysfunctional neural synchronization. Important tools to study electrophysiology of such neural networks are microelectrode arrays (MEA), which record extracellular local field potentials on multiple electrodes at different locations of the network and provide information on electrical activity, firing patterns, and synchronicity of the neural networks.

Hence, narciclasinemediated activation of RhoA could cause a hyperstabilization of the cytoskeleton and thus impair migration. This was observed in PARK2 knockout hiPSC-derived neurons, where migration was reduced by RhoA upregulation and rescued by RhoA inhibition. Likewise, methylmercury, a metal disturbing neural migration in humans, affected hiNPC and hNPC migration at similar concentrations. Taken together, hiNPC proliferation and migration (iNPC1/ 2) work similarly as in primary hNPCs (NPC1/2). More work is needed to understand if these two test systems have also distinct applicability domains, i.e. concerning developmental timing, or if these are redundant assays. Nevertheless, primary NPCs produce oligodendrocytes within a very short time of 5 days, whereas hiPSCs need several weeks to produce oligodendrocytes. In addition, the convolutional neuronal networks were trained to quantify neuron and oligodendrocyte differentiation in the primary NPC assays. This has not been established for differentiating hiNPC, hence objective quantification methods for cell differentiation are lacking for this test system. Therefore, the primary neurosphere assay possesses its unique selling points. 3.7 Applications of the Neurosphere Assay The Neurosphere test methods, which allow studying a large variety of neurodevelopmental KE, are suitable for many different applications ranging from basic scientific to different regulatory questions."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"methylmercury\",\"KE\",\"reduced NPC migration\""}]}

On the other hand, pyrethroids induced chromosomal aberrations, sister chromatid exchanges and micronuclei in mammalian cell cultures including human cells. However, in human in vivo studies no induction of chromosomal aberrations or sister chromatid exchanges were described after pyrethroid exposure with the exception that a complex of pesticides including pyrethroids led to the induction of chromosomal aberrations or that mixed exposure of pyrethroids with organophosphates and carbamates induced micronuclei in human lymphocytes.

However, a PPP-specific phosphosite recognition sequence has only been identified for protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B; also known as calcineurin) 5. Indeed, substrate recognition by PPPs, including PP2B, is predominantly achieved through the recruitment of substrates using PPP-specific short linear motifs (SLiMs; short 4-8-aa linear stretches of protein sequences that mediate protein-protein interactions) to sites distal from the active site 6-10. These PPP-specific SLiMs, which are present in either the substrates themselves or the scaffolding proteins that recruit substrates, bind directly to preformed SLiM-binding pockets on their cognate PPPs. Indeed, PPP-specific SLiMs have been identified for PP1 (refs. 8,11-15), PP2B (refs. 6,16), PP2A:B56 (refs. 7,10) and PP4 (ref. 9). Thus, most PPP-specific inhibitors and substrates use the same interaction pockets for PPP binding (that is, they compete for the same interaction sites) 1,17. Indeed, viruses have exploited this characteristic of PPP regulator and substrate binding by producing SLiM-containing proteins that inhibit PPP-specific dephosphorylation by binding and blocking PPP regulator-binding or substrate-binding sites, rendering them unable to recruit and, in turn, dephosphorylate their specific substrates 6,18-20. Notably, for PP2B, blockage of regulator-binding and substrate-binding sites is also used by the immunosuppressant drugs FK-506 and cyclosporin A 6.

This sentiment is one that is reflected in the OECD test guideline 249 document, in which the gill cell has been described as not being well suited to study neurotoxic chemicals that act through specific ion channels or receptors typically found in the brain. The one fungicide we studied, chlorothalonil, was among the top three most toxic compounds tested, with EC50 values that ranged from approximately 1 to 3 µ M across all cell lines. Chlorothalonil has been determined to be acutely toxic to fish in vivo. It acts as a protectant fungicide that deactivates thiols, in particular glutathione, to prevent fungal spore germination, respiration, and glycolysis. Glutathione is a well-conserved antioxidant across phyla, so toxicity in nontarget species is not surprising. Of the 57 cell line-pesticide combinations studied here, 28 yielded cytotoxic responses (up to test concentrations that were either 100 or 1000 µ M). However, this also means that approximately 50% of the cell line-pesticide combinations did not yield a cytotoxicity value even though all the pesticides in our study have lethality data in vivo.

In the autism-mimicking behavioral deficits BTBR mouse model, downregulation of BDNF and decrease in neurogenesis in hippocampus were observed, which were accompanied with abnormal connection of neurons in the hippocampus and learning and memory disorders. Therefore, our and other findings suggest that co-exposure to DEHP and BPA could perturb the activation of CREB, then influence synaptic formation and plasticity in the hippocampus, and ultimately cause autistic-like behavior. Since co-exposure to DEHP and BPA has been associated with more severe adverse outcomes, their combined toxic effects were primarily focused on reproductive developmental toxicity, endocrine disruption, cancer, hepatotoxicity, and neurotoxicity. However, the findings in the existing literature on the joint action mode of DEHP and BPA co-exposure were contradictory. For instance, Zhang et al. found that the joint action mode of co-exposure to DEHP and BPA on thyroid homeostasis was antagonistic. By sharp contrast, other studies reported an additive or synergistic joint action of DEHP and BPA co-exposure, particularly on the impairments of the reproductive system. It has been shown that AOP is a highly effective approach to study the joint action mode of co-exposure to environmental pollutants.

Keywords: NAM In vitro Developmental toxicity Carbamazepine Levetiracetam Zebrafish larvae Biotransformation LC-MS Zebrafish embryo-based assays are a promising alternative for animal testing to screen new compounds for developmental toxicity. However, recent studies in zebrafish embryos showed an immature intrinsic cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated biotransformation capacity, as most CYPs were only active at the end of the organogenesis period. Data on other phase I enzymes involved in the biotransformation of xenobiotics in zebrafish embryos is limited. This information is pivotal for proteratogens needing bioactivation to exert their teratogenic potential. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether carbamazepine (CBZ) and levetiracetam (LTC), two antiepileptic drugs that require bioactivation to exert their teratogenic potential, are biotransformed into non-CYP mediated metabolites in the zebrafish embryo and whether one or more of these metabolites cause developmental toxicity in this species. In the first step, zebrafish embryos were exposed to LTC and CBZ and their nonCYP mediated human metabolites, etiracetam carboxylic acid (ECA) and 9-acridine carboxaldehyde (9ACA), acridine (AI), and acridone (AO), respectively, from 5.25 to 120 hpf and morphologically evaluated. Next, the uptake of all compounds and the formation of the metabolites were assessed using LC-MS methods.

Jansson ͼ Phthalates are known endocrine disruptors and associated with decreased fecundity, pregnancy loss, and adverse obstetrical outcomes, however the underlying mechanisms remain to be established. Environmental factors can influence gene expression and cell function by modifying epigenetic marks, impacting the developing embryo as well as future generations of offspring. The impact of phthalates on placental gene methylation and expression is largely unknown. We studied the effect of maternal phthalate exposure on the human placental DNA methylome and transcriptome. We determined epigenome-wide DNA methylation marks (Illumina Infinium Human Methylation;ͻͶk BeadChip) and gene expression (Agilent whole human genome array) associated with phthalate exposure in first trimester placenta.

It has also been reported in recipients of solid organs other than the kidney and in patients with autoimmune diseases. It manifests as two distinct and well-characterized forms, namely, acute and chronic nephrotoxicity. Multiple biomarkers of CsA neprotoxicity have been identified to date. These biomarkers, which have not been reviewed to date, include urine proteins such as RBP and blood proteins such as indoxyl sulfate. The identification of biomarkers that effectively detect CsA nephrotoxicity is crucial as it permits the quick clinical detection and treatment of this disease. In this section, the clinical reports of CsA nephrotoxity in humans, and the specific symptoms of this disease, are summarized. Moreover, the potential biomarkers of CsA nephrotoxicity are reviewed and discussed. CsA is nephrotoxic in humans, especially transplant patients. For example, the clinical experience of a Romanian medical center for more than 10 years showed that when heart-transplant recipients were treated with CsA, 20% developed significant chronic decreases in their kidney function. Moreover, CsA generates nephrotoxicity by direct effects on renal tubular epithelial cells that include the induction of EMT. EMT not only plays an important role in embryonic development and tumorigenesis, it also participates in the organ remodeling that occurs when chronically diseased parenchymal organs such as the kidney undergofibrosis. A human renal cell line treated with CsA, elevated the expression of both the profibrotic protein TGFβ 1 and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) expression."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"Targets renal tubular epithelial cells\""}]}

Since these 15 individual AOPs are causal constructions and putative, the proposed HFRT-AOP network is also causal and putative, which can affect the confidence of network models in predicting toxicity and chemicals' safety. Despite these shortcomings, the HFRTAOP could be a useful tool to predict the human female reproductive toxicity of chemicals in animal-fee settings."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Using a promoter assay, we found that Ca 2 þ -responsive elements including a CRE are involved in the DM-induced activation of the Bdnf promoter IV ( Bdnf-pIV ). The intracellular concentration of Ca 2 þ and activation of Bdnf-pIV remained elevated for, at least, 1 and 24 h, respectively. Moreover, GABAA receptor activation or a blockade of Ca 2 þ influx even after starting the incubation with DM reduced the elevated activity of Bdnf-pIV. These data demonstrated that the prolonged activation of Bdnf-pIV occurred because of this continuous increase in the intracellular Ca 2 þ concentration. Thus, DM has neurotrophic effects on neurons, likely due to prolonged activation of Bdnf promoter in neurons.

However, in the case of TDS in men, testicular cancer may occur as well. To conclude, phthalates induce testicular damage and external genital malformations. These symptoms are known as phthalate syndrome in male rats and TDS in men. Other male reproductive disorders related to phthalate exposure include dysfunctions of puberty. This topic will be discussed in the next part of the chapter. 4.3. Phthalates Can Influence Male Puberty and Its Dysfunctions Pubertal development is a multiphase process controlled by several hormonal mechanisms.

However, the majority of non-drug chemicals interact with biological systems in a non-selective manner, and many individual pathways critical to organismal development are activated by a wide variety of chemical classes. The benefit of apical endpoint toxicity testing in living animals is that chemical effects on a multitude of complex processes involved in organismal development and function are covered, while the drawback is that MOA are not identified. Assessments of growth and behavior, including tests that evaluate non-cognitive behavioral endpoints such as spontaneous locomotor activity, are critical components of developmental toxicity testing and chemical hazard assessment. The addition of data from small model organisms such as C. elegans to in vitro battery testing can provide MOA-agnostic coverage of adverse effects on different life stages and complex biological processes, providing a guide to reduction and refinement of follow-up testing in laboratory mammals. 5-fluorouracil (5FU) is a chemotherapy drug with cytotoxic, reproductive, developmental, and teratogenic effects. Maternal 5FU exposures reduce fetal weight in mice and rats, and in C. elegans continuous exposure from first feeding after hatching induces delays to developmental milestones at 2 -5 µ g/mL 5FU in nutrient medium.

Decreased PPAR c activity leads to decreased expression of Hydroxysteroid 17-Beta Dehydrogenase 10 (or 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase type-2) (KER260), leading to impaired ß-oxidation and mitochondrial dysfunction, and therefore to lipid accumulation. Interestingly, a direct relationship between obesity and thyroid diseases has been suggested. New and innovative computational strategies are needed to help in the identification of health effects of chemical substituents and mixture, and to link them to AOPs that could be used for regulatory risk assessment. We believe that the development of systems toxicology approaches that relies on existing data, as the one proposed here, is extremely relevant in the area of IATA that contribute to the reduction of animal testing.

The TH-dependent maturation of hNPC-derived OLs within the NPC6 assay further reacts to the synthetic antagonist NH-3 since NH-3 concentration-dependently reduced the Q indicating that disruptors of TH receptor signaling can be identified with the NPC6 assay ( Figure 6D adapted from Klose et al., Dach et al. ). A human-relevant disruptor of OL maturation identified within the NPC6 assay is TBBPA. At low concentrations, not yet affecting OL differentiation, TBBPA disturbs TH-dependent OL maturation, hence concentration-dependently reducing the Q in hNPCs differentiated in presence of 3 nM T3 ( Figure 6E adapted from Klose et al. ). Impaired OL maturation is accompanied by alteration of TH-dependent genes, including EGR1, IGFBP4, IL33 and KLF9. These data provide the scientific basis for studying the disruption of TH-dependent oligodendrocyte maturation in differentiating hNPC.

Prenatal exposure to 10 and 100 mg / kg DEHP-modulated gene expression and subsequently, hormone activity via DNA methylation in male Wistar rats. This process of hypermethylation occurred in the SF-1 and Sp-1 transcription factors and genes for steroidogenic enzymes of Leydig cells. This could trigger TDS or other reproductive disorders in males. On the contrary, phthalates, e.g., BBzP and DBP at 10-7 M induced DNA hypomethylation or the demethylation of the ER α gene sequences of MCF7 cells. Maternal exposure to DEHP at 40 µ g / kg inhibited the DNA methylation of Igf2r and Peg3 genes in F1 and F2 mouse oocytes. These genes are essential for germ cell proliferation. This interaction influenced the quality of the next generation of germ cells. In conclusion, the results from in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that phthalate exposure is associated with altered gene expression and epigenetic processes, which are regulated by NR signaling.

Aldicarb and chlorpyrifos were negative in the hNNF but altered network formation in the rNNF assay. Acetaminophen was tested negative in both assays.

However, its therapeutic index is narrow, and it is prone to adverse side effects, along with an increased risk of toxicity, namely, cardio, nephro, hepato, and neurotoxicity. Prior metabolomic investigations involving Tac-driven toxicity primarily focused on changes in individual organs. However, extensive research on multiple matrices is uncommon. Hence, in this research, the authors systemically evaluated Tac-mediated toxicity in major organs, namely, serum, brain, heart, liver, lung, kidney, and intestines, using gas chromatography -mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The authors also employed multivariate analyses, including orthogonal projections to the latent structure (OPLS) and t-test, to screen 8 serum metabolites, namely, D-proline, glycerol, D-fructose, D-glucitol, sulfurous acid, 1-monopalmitin (MG (16:0/0:0/0:0)), glycerol monostearate (MG (0:0/18:0/0:0)), and cholesterol. Metabolic changes within the brain involved alterations in the levels of butanamide, tartronic acid, aminomalonic acid, scyllo-inositol, dihydromorphine, myo-inositol, and 11-octadecenoic acid.

Furthermore, there is a large diversity of mechanisms involved in female reproductive toxicity, such as immune disruption, DNA adduct formation, altered cellular proliferation, and inappropriate cellular death. To address some of these challenges, the development of the AOP network related to human female reproduction offers a potential opportunity to increase the efficiency of testing, generate predictive models, and link EDs to complex human female disorders across different biological levels of organization. The applicability of the HFRT-AOP network was exercised by mapping DEHP to the network, thus identifying divergent paths by which DEHP can cause female reproductive dysfunction. This approach has allowed for identification of potentially relevant MIEs, KEs, data gaps, and emergent paths where the experimental efforts should be focused to advance the mechanistic understanding of DEHP-induced female reproductive dysfunction.

One case study showed that carboplatin administration during chemotherapy caused reversible damage to the transitional epithelium and proximal tubules, resulting in hematuria and acute kidney failure. Unlike cisplatin and carboplatin, oxaliplatin has reduced nephrotoxicity. However, there have been numerous cases published reporting on different forms of renal toxicity and kidney failure induced by this Pt agent. Kidney biopsies have shown that patients can develop interstitial nephritis and tubular vacuolisation, severe type 2 proximal tubular acidosis, autoimmune haemolytic anaemia with thrombocytopenia and immune-related intravascular haemolysis coinciding with acute renal failure and necrosis during chemotherapy courses of oxaliplatin treatment. The overall confidence level in the AOP was evaluated using the evolved Bradford-Hill weight of evidence criteria outlined by Becker et al. (Table 3).

Chemical-induced tubular necrosis can occur via several upstream mechanisms, including oxidative stress, inflammation, lipid peroxidation, ischaemia through vasoconstriction, and urate deposition. Perturbations of this KE can trigger downstream processes, including increased blood potassium and uric acid concentrations, kidney toxicity, and kidney failure. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction were also identified as primary upstream KEs. Oxidative stress can emerge from several KEs, including alterations to the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) antioxidant pathway, the increased general production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and kidney ischaemia. In turn, this may lead to downstream mitochondrial dysfunction (incorporating ETC disruption) and tubular necrosis. Mitochondrial dysfunction can further manifest through decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), depletion of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and the alkylation of key proteins. Downstream influences of mitochondrial dysfunction included inhibition of NF-κβ, increased apoptosis, decreased mtATP production, and increased cytotoxicity. It was also shown to be part of a feedback loop with oxidative stress and alterations to Nrf2 signalling. Increased ROS, blood potassium concentrations, and cardiac arrhythmia were shared by three AOPs, whereas glutathione oxidation, increased hyperplasia, blood uric acid concentration, urate deposition, and increased regenerative cell proliferation were shared by two. Inhibition of the mtETC complexes was the only MIE to be shared by multiple AOPs, all leading to kidney toxicity."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

For instance, a potential additive or even synergistic effect is suggested when the commonly shared KEs change in the same direction. AOP-Wiki (https://aopwiki.org/) serves as a publicly accessible repository for AOPs and has been widely used in the research community. Currently, only one AOP (AOP ID: 8) in the AOP-Wiki relates to the neurodevelopmental toxicity of DEHP and BPA. This specific AOP addresses the adverse outcome of hearing loss caused by impaired cochlear development. Moreover, there are 14 reported AOPs linked to neurodevelopmental toxicities, which comprise a range of adverse outcomes, including learning and memory impairment (5 AOPs), cognitive dysfunction (4 AOPs), neural tube defects (3 AOPs), hearing loss (1 AOP), and periventricular heterotopia (1 AOP). Intriguingly, no AOPs directly related to ASD have been identified yet. In this study, by using computational toxicological methods and integrating publicly accessible databases, we identify two linear AOPs connecting DEHP and BPA to autism-like behavior and predict a possible additive or synergistic action mode for the development of ASD induced by co-exposure of DEHP and BPA.

These issues often lead to poor predictive model performance. Stacking ensemble learning enhances performance by combining predictions from multiple base models, enabling the stack model to improve overall generalization. Active learning (AL), on the other hand, reduces the need for large-scale data sets by effectively training models using carefully selected samples. One effective approach to address data imbalance is the use of strategic sampling techniques. Hereby, we introduce an active stacking-deep learning framework that integrates deep neural networks (DNNs), including a convolutional neural network (CNN), a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), and an attention mechanism, with strategic data sampling to tackle challenges posed by imbalanced and limited data, ultimately improving the performance of a chemical risk assessment predictive model. In this study, we focused on thyroid-disrupting chemicals (TDCs) that target thyroid peroxidase, as they are linked to thyroid dysfunction, making it essential to evaluate their risks to human health. Using stacking ensemble learning with strategic sampling within an AL framework, our approach achieved an MCC of 0.51, AUROC of 0.824, and AUPRC of 0.851. Although performance decreased across varying test ratios, our uncertainty-based method demonstrated superior stability under severe class imbalance."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"thyroid-disrupting chemicals (TDCs)\",\"AO\",\"Thyroid dysfunction\"\n\"thyroid-disrupting chemicals (TDCs)\",\"MIE\",\"Targeting thyroid peroxidase (TPO)\"\n\"thyroid-disrupting chemicals (TDCs)\",\"AO\",\"Hypothyroidism\"\n\"thyroid-disrupting chemicals (TDCs)\",\"KE\",\"Interference with thyroid hormone (TH) synthesis\"\n\"thyroid-disrupting chemicals (TDCs)\",\"KE\",\"Formation of MIT and DIT\""}]}

Currently, the most successful approaches for controlling PPN are extensive use of chemical nematicides, including fumigant nematicide methyl bromide, carbamate and organophosphate-based nematicides. However, these nematicides have now been banned or highly restricted due to their environmental and human health risks. There is an urgent need to identify potential target sites in nematodes that can be exploited for their control. Pyrethroids are widely used pesticides and divided into two types according to the presence or absence of cyano group. Type-II pyrethroid has a cyano group at the α -position, while type-I does not. The primary targets for the action of pyrethroids are VGSCs. Pyrethroids reduce the dynamic process of both the activation and inactivation of VGSCs, a b s t r a c t resulting in a prolonged depolarizing tail current that can lead to increased excitability.

However, when the valproate concentration was increased to 3 mM due to extensive literature describing neurodevelopmental effects at millimolar concentrations that can occur with therapeutic use of valproate, 3 measures of network spike behavior (the percent of spikes found in network spikes, the SD of network spike duration, and the mean number of spikes found in each network spike) were impacted at concentrations below those where substantial cell viability reduction was observed (Supplementary Table 2). Regardless of the reason for not detecting network effects for a subset of in vivo DNT hazards, these results support the view that integrating results from a battery of rapid and scalable assays will be critical for comprehensive identification of DNT hazard. Monitoring multiple important neurodevelopmental processes with different sets of molecular targets will be key to complementing the shortcomings of individual assays and improving decision making that safeguards human health. Currently, many of these assays are based on human models from embryonic or inducible stem cells, whereas the MEA-based assay presented here uses rat primary cultures. In the future, it may be possible to incorporate human neural models into the network formation assay, but this will depend on the availability of human models that have an ontogeny rapid enough (2-3weeks) to make a medium throughput assay feasible."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

LTB 4 is also related to inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (3), bronchial asthma (4), psoriasis (5), ulcerative colitis (6), and postischemic tissue injuries (7, 8).

Overall, the AOP affords visualization of pathways and identification of linkages between different biomarker responses, thus giving a rationale for predicting toxic effects across levels of biological organization. In a natural ecosystem, population-level responses are most relevant for natural resource management; but, for species with special conservation status, population-level responses are less important (e.g., threatened or endangered, or highly valued to a particular stakeholder group); effects at the level of the individual may have important population consequences. The generalized AOP proposed by emphasizes that adverse outcomes at the organismal level should inform the ERA (ecological risk assessment) (e.g., impaired survival, growth, reproduction). Since traditional laboratory-derived acute toxicity benchmarks (e.g., NOEC, LC, and EC ) do not fully predict adverse effects from ecologically complex contamination scenarios, The findings of this study using Mozambique tilapia suggest that behavior is a very sensitive endpoint, and that deltamethrin is an impactful toxin with a moderate toxic effect on O. mossambicus.

The search for MIE/KE in an abstract was based on the creation of acyclic weighted graphs that use the positions of stemmed terms. The edges characterizing these graphs had a weight that was the distance between two nodes (positions of two different terms). Given the notion of weight on edges, we decided to use Dijkstra ' s algorithm because it supportsfinding the shortest path in a weighted acyclic graph. The acyclic property was composed of a step-by-step process, starting from the term n to the term n +1, without returning to the n th term (unidirectional). Since the graphs that are formed are acyclics, the algorithmic complexity was solved by a maximum of O ð n 2 + m Þ calculations, where n represents the number of nodes, and m the number of edges in a graph O. Dijkstra ' s theory is represented by a quadratic complexity, i.e., O ð n 2 Þ. Considering all the existing MIE/KE, which have an average of four terms, the use of Dijkstra ' s algorithm resulted in a faster calculation compared with the use of a table. Therefore, the weight of the edges was used tofind the shortest paths of the stemmed terms.

Additionally, the authors also observed marked increases in L-valine in our Tac-treated mice. Alteration in L-valine was also found in other toxic kidney's injury studies. L-valine is a branched-chain amino acid that links only to carbohydrates (glycogenic). Valine is intricately linked to insulin resistance, and elevated serum valine concentrations were reported in both diabetic mice and humans. Thus, it is obvious that L-valine participates in the progression of Tacinduced nephrotoxicity. Herein, the authors systematically assessed Tac-toxicity using GC -MS-based profiling of target tissues. Toxicity is the most common and significant result of elevated blood Tac concentrations. Owing to its narrow therapeutic window, close monitoring of this therapeutic drug is imperative for treatment individualization. Unfortunately, it is still difficult to predict a particular dose that is optimal for a specific patient. Therefore, the effect of different dosages on metabolic profiles needs further investigation. In conclusion, in this study, the authors reported an extensive metabolic profile following Tac exposure in mice. The authors demonstrated that the altered metabolism involved cellular processes like lipid, amino acid, and carbohydrate metabolism, which may, in turn, provide certain insight into the pathogenesis of Tacmediated toxicity.

These issues are common in many ML applications, such as healthcare, finance, and engineering. This highlights the need for researchers to come up with strategies to effectively address class imbalance. 16 Addressing the challenge of imbalanced data sets is essential in ML. Researchers have developed various strategies to handle this issue, generally categorized into data-level methods, algorithm-level methods, and hybrid approaches. Data-level methods involve modifying the training data by oversampling the minority classes or undersampling majority classes. Algorithm-level methods refine learning algorithms to reduce bias toward majority groups. Hybrid methods combine both strategies to leverage their strengths while minimizing weaknesses. Moreover, advanced techniques for addressing imbalanced data with deep neural networks (DNNs) have extended traditional approaches. Researchers indicates that DNNs, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are effective for this purpose. 19 This study utilizes three distinct networks: CNNs, bidirectional long-term memory (BiLSTM), and attention mechanism. CNNs excel at extracting molecular features by learning spatial information. 28,29 BiLSTM captures molecular relationships by processing data in both forward and backward directions, 30 which is also practical for toxicity predictions."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"TDCs\",\"AO\",\"Hypothyroidism\"\n\"TDCs\",\"KE\",\"Coupling of MIT and DIT to produce T3/T4\""}]}

As a chemical exerting adverse effects on hNPC proliferation, we selected cadmium chloride. Prenatal exposure to cadmium chloride is associated with a lower child intelligence score, memory deficits, and learning disabilities in children. In rodents, cadmium causes behavioral and neurotoxicological changes. Hence, it is listed amongst the compounds triggering DNT. Cadmium is acting via the induction of oxidative stress, thus causing cell death and affecting mTOR, Erk1/2, and JNK signaling pathway activity. In mouse neural stem/progenitor cells, cadmium remarkably influenced the expression of genes related to cell growth, proliferation, cell cycle, and survival. In the present study, concentration-dependent inhibition of hNPC proliferation was observed following exposure to cadmium chloride compared to the solvent control without any observed cytotoxicity ( Figure 2E adapted from Masjosthusmann et al. ). Of note, the effects on NPC1b (BrdU incorporation) were much more pronounced compared to NPC1a (sphere size), highlighting that NPC1b is the more sensitive endpoint since differences in DNA replication by far precede the microscopic changes.

The sorption process seems to be a suitable candidate even for the scale-up and real application as a tertiary step in water treatment plants. Various types of sorbents have been successfully tested, including specially modified organoclays with cationic surfactants, lignite activated cokes, and biological activated carbon. In this study, acute toxicity of various DCF and TCS concentrations was assessed by the freshwater microalga Raphidocelis subcapitata applied as a living (free) culture and/or in an alginate (immobilized) form. Simultaneously, the removal of DCF and TCS from water by sorption and photo-processes was performed. The rate and efficiency of sorption were compared with contaminants' disintegration by photocatalytic and photolytic processes, which are considered to be highly effective methods.

To this end, we DualTransORGAN (Figure 1C), is a deep generative model based on a GAN with a transformer encoder and decoder. DualTransORGAN generates plausible structures that capture the semantic features of a compound via reinforcement learning using stochastic policy gradients. The proposed algorithms are detailed in the \"method details\" section. As a case study, we generated compounds that interact with two therapeutic targets of bronchial asthma: adeno develop fragment and deep learning-based structure generators for designing the chemical structures of compounds that can likely interact with two therapeutic targets. The usefulness of the method is demonstrated in a case study involving dualtarget compounds for two therapeutic targets of bronchial asthma.

Additionally, the cerebral cortex, particularly layers I and VI, which are involved in higher cognitive functions, has significant expression of α7 nAChRs. Apart from their presence in regions associated with higher cognitive functions, α7 nAChRs are also found in sensory processing areas. In the thalamus, α7 nAChRs modulate synaptic transmission and contribute to sensory gating processes. Similarly, α7 nAChRs are expressed in the amygdala potentially playing a role in emotional regulation and fear conditioning. Finally, the presence of α7 nAChRs in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area highlights their involvement in modulating the dopaminergic system and reward processing. 3 | Nicotinic Receptor's Role in Memory and Cognition The hippocampus is essential for learning, cognition and the processes of memory formation, consolidation and retrieval. Additionally, spatial navigation and the development of cognitive maps are heavily reliant on proper hippocampal function, where nAChRs are densely distributed throughout all layers. The α7 nAChRs are primarily found in the granule and pyramidal cells of the hippocampus. Activation of α7 nAChRs affects neural networks through several mechanisms. First, it directly depolarizes neurons, especially interneurons, due to the high expression of α7 receptors in their somatic regions. Second, α7 nAChR activation modulates both glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission through pre and postsynaptic mechanisms."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

This regulation controls the degree of hormonal stimulation in the target tissue. In conclusion, the HPG axis regulates hormonal secretion in the organism. The main products of the HPG axis are steroid hormones. Transport proteins, such as SHBG, transport steroid hormones to the target tissue. Steroid hormones regulate processes in the target tissue by genomic, non-genomic, and epigenetic mechanisms. Regulators of reproduction are often the targets of phthalates' action. The next chapter is focused on the primary mechanism of phthalate toxicity, physical and chemical properties of phthalates, and the definition of phthalate exposure sources. 3. Structure, Source, and Toxicity of Phthalates Phthalates are esters of 1,2-benzene dicarboxylic acid. Their structure varies depending on the number of side chains, which are formed by dialkyl, alkyl, or aryl groups. They are colorless or slightly yellowish, oily, odorless substances, very slightly soluble in water. Their solubility decreases with the prolonging chain. Phthalic acid derivatives are much more readily soluble in organic solvents. The longer the side chain, the higher their fat solubility, and the higher the boiling point is present. Phthalates are ubiquitous chemicals used in industrial manufacturing as plasticizers, supplying plastic products with elasticity. Phthalates are divided into two main groups based on their molecular weight."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Notably, few epidemiologic studies have determined phthalate levels in pregnancy and little is known about how pregnancy impacts phthalate metabolism in humans.

Only one very mild case of CsA-associated nephrotoxicity was identified. Moreover, CsA treatment did not affect the estimated GFR. Similar to Kranz et al. that 2 years of treatment with a medium dose of CsA is relatively safe for SDNS in terms of CsA nephrotoxicity. It should be noted, however, that these two studies are limited by their retrospective design and the fact that only 25% of the patients underwent renal biopsy after longterm nephrotoxic treatment. While prospective studies on the outcomes of long-term CsA therapy in children with SDNS and SRNS would help resolve this controversy, they may not be reasonable from an ethical perspective. Therefore, the long-term use of CsA in humans, especially in renaltransplant patients, usually causes nephrotoxicity.

These descriptions utilised standardised terminology from the Collaborative Adverse Outcome Pathway Wiki (AOP Wiki), which serves as the main repository for AOPs created as part of the OECD ' s AOP Development Effort (Fig. 2). 2. The adverse outcome pathway of DNA adduct formation leading to kidney failure The sequence of KEs resulting in kidney failure caused by Pt drugs starts with Pt-DNA adduct formation acting as the MIE, leading to DNA damage (KE1), mitochondrial dysfunction (KE2), increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) (KE3), oxidative stress (KE4), inflammation (KE5), cell death (KE6) and tubular necrosis (KE7; Fig. 2). Evidence of Pt-DNA adduct formation leading to kidney failure as the adverse outcome (AO) mainly stems from experimental in vitro and in vivo studies of cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin as chemical stressors of this AOP, supplemented further with clinical trial and patient data.

Therefore, BPA can cause cardiac diseases through IL-17-induced inflammation. Based on Venn analysis and literature screening, Ca 2 + homeostasis imbalance and increased inflammatory response were designated as KE2. Literature evidence suggests that cellular Ca 2 + homeostasis, release of chelated Ca 2 + from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytoplasm, cardiac/myocardial (cell) contraction, and positive regulation of macrophage chemotaxis are the major phenotypes affected by BPA on heart function. Increased release of Ca 2 + into the cytoplasm leads to Ca 2 + homeostasis imbalance, in turn resulting in a dysfunction of cardiac/myocardial (cell) contraction. Moreover, positive regulation of macrophage chemotaxis can promote the release of large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and play an important role in inflammation. The inflammation-related phenotypes mentioned in this study like macrophage activation and monocyte extravasation can be activated by BPA. Evidence that BPA can affect human diseases by transportation of Ca 2 + is also extensive. For example, exposure to BPA can promote arrhythmia by altering myocyte Ca 2 + handling and increasing sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 + leakage. Additionally, the MAPK and AKT signaling pathways can affect the transport of Ca 2 + in heart, which enhance the relation from KE1 to KE2."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"BPA\",\"KE\",\"Release of chelated Ca2+ from sarcoplasmic reticulum into cytosol\"\n\"BPA\",\"KE\",\"Positive regulation of monocyte extravasation\"\n\"BPA\",\"KE\",\"Cellular Ca2+ homeostasis affected\"\n\"BPA\",\"KE\",\"Macrophage activation / inflammatory infiltration\"\n\"BPA\",\"KE\",\"Ca2+ homeostasis imbalance/disorder\"\n\"BPA\",\"KE\",\"Increased cardiac fibrosis\"\n\"BPA\",\"KE\",\"Heart contraction affected\"\n\"BPA\",\"KE\",\"Heart circulation affected\"\n\"BPA\",\"AO\",\"Arrhythmia / arrhythmias\"\n\"BPA\",\"KE\",\"Abnormal Ca2+ handling\"\n\"BPA\",\"KE\",\"Embryonic heart tube elongation\""}]}

Molecular docking further validated our predictions, especially for highly toxic compounds, reinforcing the reliability of our framework in identifying TDCs. These findings highlight how active stacking-deep learning with strategic sampling can transform toxicity prediction, offering a more accurate and data-efficient alternative to traditional chemical risk assessment methods. Stacking ensemble learning is a powerful machine learning (ML) technique that combines the predictions of multiple base models to build a more accurate and robust final model. By leveraging the strengths of diverse models, stacking reduces reliance on trial-and-error approaches, thereby improving adaptability and performance over time. 1 -3 In this study, the stacking concept follows the hierarchical modeling technique introduced in previous research. 4 Each base model is typically trained on different features or algorithms, allowing the ensemble to capture complementary patterns and reduce individual model bias. The out-of-fold (OOF) predictions from these base learners are then used as inputs for a secondlayer model, which learns to optimize overall performance. This layered approach helps manage variability and improve generalization. 4 -6 As a result, model stacking is recognized as a key advancement in various fields, including chemical risk assessment. In the field of quantitative structure -activity relationship (QSAR) modeling, model stacking holds significant promise. Given its potential, research developments have enhanced the ability to identify toxic substances and improve safety evaluations."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Active Stacking-Deep Learning with Strategic Sampling Technique. We addressed data imbalance through the innovative k subset sampling technique. Our approach is based on the partitioning ksubgroups from the number of minority class to the majority class. Initially, our initial AL data set (10% of data pool) was highly imbalanced, featuring in an active-to-inactive ratio of 1:6. To address this, we divided the inactive compounds into six equal subsets based on k -subset as mentioned before. Each inactive subset was paired with a full set of active compounds to create six balanced data sets. This strategy was designed to enhance the model's performance and fairness, which is crucial for achieving reliable predictive results. For each balanced data set, we generated 36 OOF probability features (PFs) from 12 molecular fingerprints and three DNN models using a stacking ensemble learning technique. These OOF PFs were used to train six different stack models based on the k -subset method. The models provided probability outputs, which were averaged for final predictions.

Key words: artificial intelligence; AOP-helpFinder; integrative systems toxicology; adverse outcome pathway network; HBM4EU. Bisphenol A (BPA) is a presumed endocrine disruptor due to its chemical similarity to natural estrogens and also a metabolic disruptor and neurotoxicant. Several studies have been carried out to understand its modes of action (MoA). Some of these studies revealed effects at lower doses than the no-observed-adverse-effect levels, mostly corresponding to the regulation of non-genomic pathways whereas the activation of nuclear receptors were involved at higher doses. Bisphenol A has been banned in some countries (Canada, EU) for some specific uses (baby bottles, coating of infant formula). This led to replacement of BPA for the production of epoxy resins and polycarbonate to reduce putative adverse effects. As a consequence, there is an increasing use of substituents such as bisphenol S (BPS) in thermal paper, bisphenol B, and bisphenol F (BPF) and its isomers in canned foods and soft drinks. However, the MoA and potential toxicities of BPA analogs are still poorly characterized. Whether these substituents are safer than BPA remains a matter of debate. Linking BPF and other BPS to adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) and therefore enhancing our knowledge on their putative toxicities is a major challenge for regulatory needs."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Bisphenol F (BPF)\",\"MIE\",\"ERα activation\"\n\"Bisphenol F (BPF)\",\"KE\",\"Absence of activation of p27\"\n\"Bisphenol F (BPF)\",\"KE\",\"Allergic contact dermatitis challenge\""}]}

Amyloid precursor protein synthesis starts in the nucleus of most cell types and is then transported to the cell surface as a transmembrane protein. Amyloid precursor protein endocytosis and subsequent cleavage by beta and gamma-secretase lead to amyloid-beta production. The site of action of gamma-secretase on amyloid precursor protein determines whether amyloidbeta 40 or amyloid-beta 42 will be created.

In brief, RG migration is assessed manually on bright field pictures, taken with the Cellomics ArrayScan using a 50-fold magnification, by measuring the radial distance of the furthest migrated cells to the sphere core as number of pixels following conversion into µm using Fiji Image J software. After 120 h, RG migration is evaluated automatically by defining the area of Hoechst33258-stained nuclei as the migration area of this particular sphere using the Omnisphero software. Additionally, the migratory capacity of neurons (NPC2b) and oligodendrocytes (NPC2c), defined as the mean distance of all neurons/oligodendrocytes within the migration area divided by the RG migration distance, is automatically assessed after 120 h. The validation of the NPC2b and NPC2c assay is not included in this manuscript. For the scientific validation of the NPC2a assay, hNPCs were exposed to human-relevant pathway modulators as well as known DNT-positives during the 5 days of differentiation. Neurospheres were differentiated in presence of 1) epidermal growth factor (EGF, 0.5 -1 ng/ml) alone or in combination with the EGF receptor-inhibitor PD153035 (1 -2 µM), 2) the Src-kinase inhibitor PP2 (10 µM), 3) increasing concentrations of methylmercury (MeHg, 0.003 -2.22 µM) or 4) the respective solvent (solvent control).

Considered as the first anchor of AOP, MIE performs a biological interaction at the molecular level and leads to the changes in cell, tissue, or organ level by presenting the interference effects in an organism, eventually causing the AO performed as different diseases or pathological changes. KEs depict the intermediate processes comprising responses in cells, tissues and organs, functioning as the linkage between MIE and AO, and KEs are connected by key event relation (KER). Successful examples of AOP construction have demonstrated the function that AOP can improve the structure of risk assessment and promote the integration of information. Additionally, AOP assessment has gradually become an important issue, for which the quantitative weight of evidence (QWOE) method emerges as the requirement.

Phthalate exposure can induce reproductive disorders at various regulatory levels. The aim of this review was to compile the evidenceconcerningtheassociationbetweenphthalatesandreproductivediseases, phthalates-induced reproductive disorders, and their possible endocrine and intracellular mechanisms. Phthalates may induce alterations in puberty, the development of testicular dysgenesis syndrome, cancer, and fertility disorders in both males and females. At the hormonal level, phthalates can modify the release of hypothalamic, pituitary, and peripheral hormones. At the intracellular level, phthalates can interfere with nuclear receptors, membrane receptors, intracellular signaling pathways, and modulate gene expression associated with reproduction. To understand and to treat the adverse e GLYPH<11> ects of phthalates on human health, it is essential to expand the current knowledge concerning their mechanism of action in the organism.

The structure of p107 bound to PP2A:B55 confirms that this is the case, with p107 621 RVKEVRTD 628 residues binding the B55 platform in a manner identical to FAM122A 84 RLHQIKQE 91 (Fig. 4d). Like R84 FAM122A, R621 p107 forms a bidentate salt bridge with D197 B55 (pocket P4), a residue previously shown to be essential for p107 binding 33. The conformation of R621 is stabilized by intramolecular electrostatic interactions with E624 and D628 p107 and an intermolecular π -stacking interaction with H179 B55 (pocket P4) (Fig. 4e). Similarly, V622 p107 and V625 p107 anchor p107 to the B55 platform through the same hydrophobic pockets used by L85 and I88 FAM122A (bound to pockets P2 and P1, respectively; P2: L225 B55 and V228 B55; P1: Y178 B55, L198 B55, M222 B55, L225 B55 and V228 B55 ).

Studies on the exact functions of NO in CsA nephrotoxicity are needed. Compared with other pathways, there is relatively little information on the role of NKκ B pathway in CsA nephrotoxicity. Very recently, Jin et al. reported that Klotho, an anti-aging protein, ameliorates CsA-induced nephropathy by downregulating kidney inflammation via the PDLIM2/NFκ B p65 signaling pathway. Specifically, when mice transfected with a Klotho-expressing adenovirus were treated with CsA, they exhibited less CsA nephrotoxicity than the wild-type mice; this associated with decreased NFκ B p65 expression, increased expression of PDLIM2, and reduced production of inflammatory cytokines and iNOS. Moreover, treatment of primary human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells with soluble Klotho protein and LPS reduced their NF-kB p65 expression and increased their PDLIM2 expression. Co-treatment with PDLIM2 siRNA blocked the ability of Klotho to inhibit the expression of NF-kB p65. Several studies suggest that NFκ B is a target molecule of CsA and that CsA-induced inhibition of NFκ B in non-T cells. CsA inhibits the IL-17 production of CD4 + T cells and this effect is mediated by the IL-15-activated NFκ B pathway. This effect of CsA may explain why CsA effectively treats rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, CsA significantly suppresses NFκ B p65 and I κ B α expression and NFκ B DNA-binding activity in cardiac xenografts. This associates with prolongation of the survival of the xenografts.

However, recent studies reported that they could have an accumulation effect in human which may cause series of health problems. Estrogen receptors (ER) are a class of nuclear receptors that are vital in proper physiological behavior of estrogens. To investigate the reproductive toxicity of pyrethroids, homology modeling, molecular docking, molecular dynamic simulations (MDs) were conducted to explore the interaction between pyrethroids and ER α from atomic scale. The human ER α (2YJA) was selected as a template protein for homology modeling. Then eight typical pyrethroids and positive control estradiol were docked to the modeled protein. The highest scoring bifenthrin and the lowest scoring permethrin were chosen for in-depth analysis. MDs showed that the complex formed by permethrin with ER α had a lower RMSD value and binding free energies compared to bifenthrin. Based on these results from microscopic dimension, exposure experiments were implemented to validate the primary conclusions. VTG concentrations in male zebrafish ' s blood were significantly higher under permethrin exposure than bifenthrin, suggesting a stronger estrogenic activity and binding propensity.

The cases are characterized by hepatocellular injury, prolonged hospitalization and included a patient with fatal Stevens-Johnson syndrome. In their study 38% of diclofenac DILI cases presented fever, rash and eosinophilia, and the findings are consistent with the clinical features of drug hypersensitivity reactions. Altogether, the proposed AOP of immune-mediated and allergic hepatitis is relevant for human DILI induced by NSAIDs. How can the AOP concept be translated into clinical and regulatory practice? Biomarkers based on AOPs carry the potential to significantly improve an assessment of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). In specific, ADRs are assessed by expert opinion and the guidance given by the WHO and regulatory authorities. Furthermore, the magnitude and the incidence of ADRs are evaluated by postmarketing surveillance and the legally required period safety updated reports (PSUR).

Consistent with the proficiency chemicals, measures of bioactivity and potency defined by the TCPL analysis were used to classify core chemical effects. Importantly, the only discordance noted when using these parameters was butylparaben and letrozole for T biosynthesis (Table 4; Supplementary Data Plots). It is of interest to note that 3/5 labs did not report a LOEC for butylparaben in the validation study and the compound was technically characterized as negative in the initial OECD report. Letrozole also exhibited a clear decrease in activity at the highest tested concentration (consistent with OECD labs) and was just above the TCPL threshold for bioactivity. All other chemicals were classified appropriately, supporting high reproducibility with the validated guideline method.

At the synaptic cleft, brief exposure to high concentrations of an agonist causes a synchronous opening of nAChR pores, while prolonged exposure leads to partial activation and significant desensitization, resulting in the receptors entering a closed, unresponsive state. This mechanism is crucial in assessing the therapeutic potential of the receptor, as extended use of an α7 nAChR agonist may not sustain receptor activation. Therefore, it is important in clinical settings to consider the effects of prolonged and repeated exposure to prevent tachyphylaxis. In addition to their well characterized ionotropic function in neurons, where α7 nAChRs mediate fast excitatory signalling through calcium influx, these receptors can also engage in metabotropic signalling in glial cells such as microglia and astrocytes. Through interactions with intracellular G proteins, glial α7 nAChRs activate distinct downstream signalling pathways, which may have functional implications for neuroinflammation and synaptic modulation. This dual signalling capacity suggests that α7 targeted therapies may differentially impact neuronal and glial populations, influencing cognitive function in both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and schizophrenia, though the specific contributions of ionotropic and metabotropic signalling to cognitive improvement remain unclear across different cell types and disease contexts. In the brain, α7 nAChRs are highly expressed in areas linked to cognitive and sensory functions, memory and attention.

However, CsA strongly activates the Nrf-2 pathway in renal proximal tubular epithelial cells in vitro. This study is also of interest because the authors generated a differential equation model of the Nrf-2 pathway that they calibrated quantitatively with an omics data subset. In addition, when human tubular cells are co-treated with CsA and Schisandrin B (a natural compound), the CsA-induced cellular oxidative stress is reduced; this effect was achieved by Schisandrin B-mediated translocation of Nrf2 to the nucleus and the downstream expression of HO-1, which is a Nrf2 target gene (it also a target gene of NFκ B). Notably, CsA also stimulates HO-1 expression in human gingivalfibroblasts. Moreover, siNrf-2 treatment of the cells reduced the CsAstimulated HO-1 mRNA expression. The inhibition of ERK also significantly decreased CsA-stimulated Nrf-2 nuclear translocation and HO-1 mRNA expression. Thus, CsA-stimulated HO-1 expression is mediated by the activation of ERK and Nrf-2 plays a protective role against CsA-induced gingivalfibrosis by modulating collagen turnoverrelated genes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"Nrf2 pathway activation in tubular epithelial cells\"\n\"Schisandrin B\",\"KE\",\"Reduces CsA-induced cellular oxidative stress via Nrf2/HO-1\"\n\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"p-Smad2/3 nuclear translocation\"\n\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"PTEN decreased during CsA-induced EMT in vitro\"\n\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"CTGF induced downstream of TGF-β1\""}]}

The molecular basis of substrate recruitment to B56, which is a heat repeat protein, is well established as B56 binds substrates and regulators that contain LxxIxE SLiMs, with the binding affinities of distinct SLiMs modulated by phosphorylation and/or adjacent dynamic charge-charge interactions 7,10,24. In contrast, much less is known about the mechanism(s) of substrate and regulator recruitment for the most abundant PP2A holoenzyme, PP2A:B55 (B55 is a WD40 domain; Fig. 1a) 25,26. Recently, we determined the structures of two protein inhibitors, phosphorylated ARPP19 and FAM122A, bound to PP2A:B55 (ref. 27). The interactions were extensive, leading to the identification of multiple surfaces on B55, whose shallow pockets collectively mediate tight inhibitor binding, including the B55 platform (pockets P1-P6), the B55 wall (P7-P9), the B55 entry and the B55 hook (P10) (Fig. 1a-c). These structures also showed that ARPP19 and FAM122A bind PP2A:B55 through helices rather than extended interactions, suggesting that B55-based recruitment is fundamentally distinct from that of its fellow PPP members. While some PP1 regulators were previously shown to bind PP1 using helices in addition to canonical PP1-specific SLiM motifs (Inhibitor 2, spinophilin, NIPP1 and MYPT1), it was the SLiM motifs that were essential for PP1 binding."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

These inputs arise both from efferent projections into vlPAG from areas like the CeM and PBN, as well as locally-synapsing PAG Penk neurons ( Extended Data Fig. 9e-f ). Because Penk and met-enkephalin protein are so highly expressed in vlPAG, we hypothesized that the source of painrelieving enkephalin release in vlPAG is from within vlPAG itself. To investigate this possibility, we performed optogenetic stimulation of Penk + neurons in vlPAG with the excitatory opsin ChrimsonR during fiber photometry recordings of enkephalin release with δ Light ( Fig. 4n ). Using a 10-second, 10-Hz optogenetic stimulation protocol, we observed light-evoked enkephalin release during and after cessation of light pulses ( Fig. 4o, left ). Compared to the pre-stimulation window, stimulation resulted in significantly increased enkephalin release that was sustained and elevated for at least 20 seconds after the stimulation occurred ( Fig. 4o, right ). Stimulating Penk neurons for 15 minutes at 10 Hz produced a more pronounced increase in enkephalin release that was maintained for at least 30 minutes after stimulation ended ( Extended Data Fig. 16a-c ). This suggests that direct activation of vlPAG Penk neurons can elevate enkephalin tone in a manner that may be antinociceptive, far outlasting the immediate effect of stimulating the neural population."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"ChrimsonR\",\"KE\",\"Light-evoked increase in enkephalin release (sustained)\"\n\"ChrimsonR\",\"KE\",\"Longer stimulation produces prolonged elevation in enkephalin release\"\n\"ChrimsonR\",\"AO\",\"Robust reduction in pain\""}]}

Moreover, expression of transcripts coding for dopaminergic, cholinergic (nicotinic and muscarinic), and NMDA receptors (NMDAR) were detected. Especially CHRNA3 and DRD2 expression was enhanced at DIV 7 and decreased with increasing maturation of the networks. The higher expression of SLC12A5 ( KCC2 ) compared to SLC12A2 ( NKCC1 ) at DIV 14 indicates that the cells had passed the GABA switch, which marks the shift from pre-mature excitatory to mature inhibitory GABAergic neurons. Taken together, the gene expression data show that the neural networks develop over time and express a broad variety of genes related to neuronal and glial function, which is a prerequisite for neural network function. MEA are important tools to study network electrophysiology. MEA recordings provide high-content data based on the recording of extracellular action potentials, so-called spikes, which are the basic unit of activity of a neural network. During the development of a network, spikes can group into bursts and can synchronize their activity, resulting in network bursts. To confirm the contribution of functional GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons in the development of the networks, we performed an acute pharmacological modulation of neural networks on DIV 21 by challenging the neuronal subtypes with the receptor antagonists BIC and CNQX.

ERR c regulates positively the expression of uncoupling protein 1 during the browning of 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which suggests that its down-regulation contributes to the increase in white adipose tissue, whereas down-regulation of HSL contributes to decreased lipolysis.

When PKA was inhibited in the CsA-treated cells, their NO production rose. Thus, inhibiting PKA may help to increase the vasodilator activity of NO and therefore prevent CsA nephrotoxicity. 6. Therapeutical strategies for CsA nephrotoxicity It is well known from the above studies that oxidative stress is a key effect of exposure of CsA. Thus, some antioxidant compounds seem to have the therapeutical potential for this toxicity. Ceftriaxone was reported to be suppress the CsA-induced oxidative stress in rat kidney by modulation of oxidative and antioxidant system. Similarly, erdosteine shows treatment potential on CsA nephrotoxicity by reducing its effect on lipid peroxidation and glomerular ROS production. Mariee and Abd-Ellah further showed that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation can attenuate the oxidative damage in rat kidney tissues. Moreover, DHA treatment significantly restored NO level. Khan et al. showed that pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) ameliorated CsA-induced renal tubular injury, inhibited TGFβ 1 expression, and prevented tubulointerstitialfibrosis in CsA-exposed murine kidneys. Ouyang et al. reported that 2-deoxy-glucose has protective effect on CsA nephrotoxicity. This effect is due to the reduction of CsA-induced ROS. Recently, nebivolol, was reported to attenuate CsA-induced impairment of renal functions, oxidative stress and restored the balance in renal NO system. Very recently, valsartan was shown to ameliorate CsA nephrotoxicity by diminishing CsA-induced renal Klotho downregulation and oxidative stress.

Using this system, we next compared the AD-214 response to that of nintedanib and pirfenidone, two therapeutics approved for the treatment of IPF (Figure S5a). Comparing AD-214 and nintedanib (Figure S5a), only one common activity was annotated within the REMyoF system (reduction of sVEGF) and 14 differentiating activities within the SAEMyoF (MCP-1, E-cadherin, M-CSF, sIL-6, sIL-8), MyoF (VCAM-1, Collagen I, PAI-1, TIMP-1), and REMyoF systems (Collagen I, IP-10, I-TAC, E-cadherin, MMP-9). Comparing AD-214 to pirfenidone (Figure S5b), again there was one common activity reduced in the SAEMyoF system, Collagen III, but only seven differentiating activities were observed within the SAEMyoF (M-CSF), MyoF (Collagen I, Collagen IV, PAI-1), and REMyoF systems (MCP-1, E-cadherin, sVEGF).

These compounds exert their endocrine disrupting effects via CYP51 and CYP19 inhibition, which play a significant role as steroidogenic enzymes. Tebuconazole is a widely used fungicide that has a sterol demethylation inhibitor effect. It has been reported that the Tebuconazole plasma half-life is approximately 600 days, and it causes toxic effects on the thyroid, liver, nervous system, and reproductive organs. In addition, it also exposes developmental and genetic toxicity.

Exposure to human beings is quite common. According to WHO, chlormequat is excreted 98% invariably and its acceptable daily intake (ADI) level is 0.05 mg/kg.bw. It is totally eliminated from the body within 46 h. It is important to investigate the potential toxic effects of chlormequat on cellular mechanisms due to the wide range of species that are exposed to it.

As for AO, autism-like behavior was used as a substitute for ASD based on the measurability criteria from the OECD guidelines.

By analyzing secondary CGPDN, we identified the cAMP signaling pathway and MAPK3 (ERK1/2) signaling pathway as the two highly ranked phenotypes that were relevant to the nervous system. This was supported by previous findings demonstrating that the inhibition of MAPK3 signaling pathway was related to the occurrence of ASD and that decreased expression of NMDAR or inhibiting the MAPK3 signaling pathway resulted in decreases in the levels of key proteins involved in synaptic formation and plasticity, such as PSD-95 and SYP. This impacted synaptic formation, plasticity, and consequently functions of the hippocampus. Functional impairments in the hippocampus and changes in synaptic formation and plasticity both have been shown to contribute significantly to the development of ASD. In the secondary CGPDNs, we found that both DEHP and BPA primarily affected synaptic plasticity, structural and functional.

Phthalates are a ubiquitous type of plasticizers used in a wide range of consumer products including toys, food packaging, cosmetic products, and medical equipment. One of the most common phthalates, di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), represents a particular public health concern because 100% of the US population have measurable levels of this EDC 2.

Furthermore, calculations of the free energy using the MMPBSA module also suggested that the binding stability of the permethrin was better. Moreover, it was evident from the energy breakdown that van der Waals forces were the main driving force for ligand binding in both systems, while polar solvent solventisation was the main inhibiting force for binding. To further examine and determine the binding of the two complex systems, zebrafish exposure experiments were conducted on the basis of the above. The results showed that both pesticides had some estrogenic activity and that this activity was positively correlated with the pesticide concentration.

For each iteration, we selected the most informative 5% of these compounds using three strategies similar to the single AL framework: uncertainty, margin, and entropy. This iterative process continued for five rounds, utilizing about 26.7% of the full data set. The flowchart of the active stacking-deep learning with strategic sampling is illustrated in Figure 2. 2.8. Model Evaluation. To evaluate our model's performance in binary classification, we focused on several important metrics. The Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) is particularly noteworthy for its robustness in handling imbalanced data sets, as it considers all four elements of the confusion matrix: true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN). It ranges from -1 to 1, where -1 indicates complete disagreement, 0 signifies random predictions, and 1 denotes perfect accuracy. Alongside the MCC, we examined the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC), and the area under the precision -recall curve (AUPRC).

Their chief advantages are high insecticidal potency and low mammalian toxicity. The pyrethroids have a highly nonpolar nature, low water solubility and high affinity to soil and sediment particulate matter. Pyrethroids show low mobility in soil and are absorbed to the sediments of natural water systems. Despite the high attachment of pyrethroids to living organisms, their capability to bioconcentrate is mitigated by their metabolism and subsequent elimination. However, there have been cases of accidental and occupational human exposures after dermal contact which have lead to acute pyrethroid poisonings. Natural pyrethrin is extracted from the flowers of Chrysanthemum spp., and its use was already known in China in the first century A.D. Pyrethroids, synthetic analogues of pyrethrin, have been produced since 1940. They are more stable in light and air than natural pyrethrin. Today there are many different synthetic pyrethroids. The increasing demand for pyrethroid products has lead chemists to focus their attention on the synthesis of new analogues with better stability in light and air, better persistence, more selectivity in target species, and lower mammalian toxicity. The natural pyrethrins are more active poisons via dermal contacts than when ingested. Human toxicity associated with pyrethroids may stem from their allergenic properties."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

We previously developed AD-114, a fully human singledomain i-body that specifically binds human CXCR4 with nanomolar affinity and is effective at inhibiting a number of CXCR4-mediated functional activities in vitro and in vivo that lead to the progression of IPF. 13,18 Being a single-domain i-body, AD-114 has a short circulatory half-life, although several approaches have been used to improve this. 19 Here, we describe the development of a second-generation molecule, AD-214, which consists of the i-body AD-114 fused to an Fc moiety from an IgG1 that has been mutated to silence its effector functions. AD-214 exhibits enhanced avidity, extended half-life, and improved manufacturability. We also show that AD-214 binding to CXCR4 can modulate intracellular signaling and block the progression of fibrosis in ex vivo human tissues, as well as a bleomycin-induced mouse model of fibrosis. Initial experiments examined the fusion of AD-114 with the Fc region of both native IgG1 and IgG2 with different linkers and with different signal peptides (Figure S1a). Inclusion of a functional Fc domain would initiate effector responses leading to immune cell killing and inflammation, which would be detrimental in the context of fibrosis; therefore, we chose the IgG1 DAPA mutant as the fusion partner for AD-114 to modulate its ability to induce FcγR-based effector functions (see below)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Urine RBP levels may be a better biomarker than the urine levels of other proteins such as β 2-microglobulin and lysozyme because its production is relatively constant. Moreover, since proteinuria precedes serum creatinine elevation, urinary RBP levels may be a marker of relatively early tubulointerstitial involvement. This is of clinical importance because the degree of tubulointerstitial injury is believed to be the best predictor of GFR and the long-term prognosis of chronic progressive renal disease. In another study, Carlos et al. found that microalbuminuria and urinary KIM-1, TNFα, andfibronectin levels rose in the early phase of CsA nephrotoxicity while the urinary levels of TGFβ, and osteopontin increased in the late phase of CsA nephrotoxicity. These urinary biomarkers exhibited consistent correlations between the kidney expression of cytokines and the temporal changes in kidney function and structure that are caused by CsA. Thus, early microalbuminuria and increases in urinary KIM-1, TNFα, andfibronectin indicate acute CsA nephrotoxicity while late elevation of urinary osteopontin and TGFβ 1 indicate chronic CsA nephrotoxicity. In addition, the proteomic analysis of the urine of mice with CsA nephrotoxicity by O'Connell et al. showed that cadherin-1, superoxide dismutase, and vinculin are involved in early CsA nephropathy. However, whether these proteins could serve as early biomarkers of CsA nephrotoxicity was not assessed.

Mitochondrial dysfunction induces oxidative stress, redox state unbalance and energy metabolism impairment to induce apoptotic cell death in cisplatin-induced kidney failure in a dose-dependent manner. A single 10 mg/kg cisplatin dose administered to male Wistar rats induced severe nephrotoxicity within 72 h, characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction. Oxidative stress markers included GSH depletion, GSSG increase, and increased lipid peroxidation. Energetic metabolism collapsed with reduced ATP synthesis and impaired calcium uptake, while apoptotic activation was evident via increased caspase-3 activity. Furthermore, cisplatin exposure was shown to induce a mitochondria-dependent ROS response that contributes to cell killing by increasing the cytotoxic effect in a time-dependent manner.

Frank, Jasmine P. Brown, Kathleen Wallace, John F. Wambaugh, Imran Shah b, Timothy J. Shafer a, ⁎ A R T I C L E I N F O The lack of information on the potential for tens of thousands of chemicals in the environment to cause developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) is well documented. Because guideline DNT studies are expensive, time-consuming and animal intensive, it is now generally recognized that it will be necessary to use a battery of in vitro screening assays to screen thousands of compounds for their potential to cause DNT and thus prioritize them for additional testing. To this end, a wide variety of assays have been developed to determine the effects of compounds on processes critical to the development of the nervous system, including proliferation, neurite outgrowth A B S T R A C T, synaptogenesis, transcriptomic responses, differentiation, and migration. Formation of interconnected neural networks is critical to development of the nervous system. In vivo formation of networks occurs as the structures of the nervous system develop, and connections between different neurons form as axons and dendrites extend using chemical and electrical cues as guidance. Similar in vitro network activity arises spontaneously in primary monolayer cultures from many different brain regions, including the cortex, hippocampus, and brainstem as dissociated neurons (re)establish synaptic connections."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Conversely, the least connected KEs, with a degree of 1, were typically the MIEs from each selected AOP. A single AO, increased adenomas/ carcinomas, also scored a degree of 1. A summary of the connectivity of those twelve KEs shared between multiple AOPs is depicted in Fig. 3. The level of KE connectivity within the network helps to determine key points of convergence and divergence (Table 2). Convergent KEs correspond to stages in the AOP network at which different pathways, ultimately sharing common toxic outcomes, are noted to meet. Divergent KEs, by contrast, represent stages whereby the downstream course of a particular pathway is liable to be altered by different factors (i.e. a fork point). Locating and understanding convergent and divergent KEs can aid in the identification and development of measurable in vitro and in silico strategies to prevent or mitigate adverse effects, as well as enhance understanding of the mechanisms underlying toxicity and disease. Since the KERs in the AOP network are directional, the connectivity (degree) of an individual KE can be further specified-either as in-degree (i.e. denoting the quantity of incoming/downstream events) or as out-degree (quantity of outgoing/upstream events). The ratio of in-degree to outdegree values can be used to determine whether a KE is convergent or divergent."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Studies on EGFR knockout mice reported a decrease in brain size, supporting the involvement of the EGFR in migratory processes during cortical development. Moreover, intraventricular administration of EGF caused migration of subependymal NPCs from the lateral ventricle into the adjacent neural tissue in the adult mouse brain. Similarly, exposure to EGF (0.5 -1 ng/ml) after neurosphere plating enhanced hNPC migration compared to the solvent control ( Figure 3C ). In addition, co-administration of the EGFR-inhibitor PD153035 (1 -2 µM) antagonized the EGFinduced migratory stimulating effect demonstrating EGF action on NPC migration via the EGFR. As a second human-relevant key regulator of migration, which is expressed in hNPCs, we assessed the effects of SRCfamily kinase inhibition on RG migration. SRC-family kinases are fundamental for brain development and disruption of their activity correlates with defects in radial migration and reelerlike malformations of cortical development. Exposure of migrating hNPCs to the SRC-family kinase inhibitor PP2 reduced hNPC migration to 40% of the solvent control without causing any signs of cytotoxicity. Our results indicate that human-relevant signaling pathways involved in neurodevelopmental migratory processes in vivo (EGFR and SRC) are preserved in the hNPC-derived cells in vitro supporting the applicability of the NPC2a assay to study cell migration during development."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"PP2\",\"KE\",\"reduced cell migration\"\n\"PD153035\",\"MIE\",\"EGFR inhibition\"\n\"PD153035\",\"KE\",\"antagonized EGF-induced migration\""}]}

The essential enzymes for steroidogenesis include P450 and HSD enzymes from mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. These enzymes can convert steroidal precursors to final hormones such as testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, progesterone, and estradiol. LHbinds to LH receptor (LHR) of thecal cells (in case of ovarian follicles) and Leydig cells (in case of testis). FSH binds to the FSH receptor (FSHR) of granulosa cells in the ovarian follicles. In these cells, FSH and LH activate a broad spectrum of signaling pathways leading to the gene expression of steroidogenic enzymes and the conversion of steroids to final products. Testosterone and dihydrotestosterone are leading male masculinization hormones. Testosterone is essential for the morphological di GLYPH<11> erentiation of the internal genital organs and maintaining spermatogenesis. Dihydrotestosterone is an androgen 10-fold more potent than testosterone and is associated with the di GLYPH<11> erentiation of male external genitals and male secondary sexual characteristics. However, androgens are vital for follicle maturation in females. Estradiol and progesterone are essential hormones for postnatal female reproductive system development and to enable ovarian and menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and labor. Estradiol is needed to maintain spermatogenesis in males, as well. In general, steroid hormones have proliferative features. They are crucial for germ cell proliferation leading to sperm production and ovarian follicles' development. Moreover, sex steroids induce cell proliferation in the non-reproductive tissue, such as the bladder, precursors of myotubes, or neural stem cells.

This configuration allows for multiple (up to 4) chips to be recorded from simultaneously. MC\\_Rack software version 3.6.8 or later (MCS) was used for data acquisition. Signals were collected with a sampling rate of 25 kHz and high pass filtered with 200 Hz cutoff. Peak to peak electrode noise levels were 8 m V or lower, well within MCS specifications for planar 30 m m Titanium Nitrite electrodes. Channels with higher levels of noise were grounded and not included in data analysis. Criteria for chip use included robust firing defined as exceeding a detection threshold level of /C6 15 m V (a software-supplied spike analyzer was used to detect spontaneous events), and a minimum of 10 active ( > 5 spikes/ min) electrodes. A 30-60 min period of stable baseline (native) activity was recorded for use as an internal reference for each chip. MEAs where activity was clearly not stable (activity on all channels increasing or declining over time) were not used for experiments. Post hoc, networks where mean activity was not stable (mean activity clearly declining or increasing over time) were not included in the analysis."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Under reducing and non-reducing SDS-PAGE analysis, the protein migrated at the expected molecular weights of approximately 37.5 and 75 kDa, respectively, for the monomeric and dimeric versions of a disulfide-linked Fc fusion protein. AD-214 is predominantly monomeric when assessed by size exclusion chromatography (Figure 1b) and has a ~10 pM binding affinity to CXCR4 when analyzed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) against human CXCR4 displayed on virus-like particles (Figure 1c). This is an almost 1,000-fold increased affinity to CXCR4 over AD114 (~4 nM). 18 This improved affinity was consistent with an increased avidity of AD-214 due to the bivalent nature of the Fc fusion. As expected, the IgG1 DAPA Fc moiety was found to interact with human FcRn with an affinity of ~48 nM (Figure 1d), similar to published affinities for wild type Fc. 20 The binding specificity of AD-214 to CXCR4 was investigated using a Membrane Proteome Array platform (Integral Molecular), which detects binding to 5,300 human membrane proteins and can be used to determine target specificity since all target proteins have native conformations and appropriate post-translational modifications. When AD-214 was tested for reactivity in this assay, only cells expressing CXCR4 were detected (Figure 1e); thus, AD-214 retains exquisite specificity for its target. Next, we determined the affinity of AD-214 for human (h) CXCR4 on cells."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Importantly, modification of the i-body with the addition of the Fc fusion at the C-terminus maintained the general mechanistic profile to the non-Fc-tagged i-body, AD-114. No change was observed to the CXCR4 binding region of the i-body, inhibition of receptor activation, and subsequent functional effects. In fact, in a dimeric format, these activities are improved, suggesting that the differences in potency are directly due to the improved design of the i-body. The further development of this Fc fusion domain to include two-point DAPA mutations abolishes interactions with Fcγ receptors that mediate effector functions and any Fcγ-mediated destruction of CXCR4-containing hemopoietic cells. The lack of effector functions, specifically ADCC, ADCP, and CDC, was confirmed by in vitro cell reporter assays. Thus, when used in a chronic disease setting, there should be no effector-mediated killing of bystander CXCR4-expressing cells necessary for normal physiological function. Blocking CXCR4 has been shown to inhibit the progression of fibrosis in several preclinical models. 12,33,34 We previously demonstrated that the antifibrotic effects of AD-214 in the unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) model of kidney fibrosis 33 and the non-Fc-tagged i-body AD-114 displayed therapeutic efficacy in the bleomycin model, as well as the folic acid model of kidney fibrosis."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"AD-214\",\"KE\",\"No Fc effector functions (ADCC/CDC/ADCP)\"\n\"AD-114\",\"KE\",\"Attenuates macrophage infiltration in kidney fibrosis model (reported prior work)\""}]}

Similarly, BUN and sCr levels could be preserved significantly in Bax-knockout mice. A decrease in apoptotic cells, tissue damage and cytochrome c release were also observed in these Bax-deficient mice. These findings were then replicated in vitro using primary cultures of proximal tubular cells prepared from these animals. Nutlin-3, an MDM2 antagonist, was also able to suppress mitochondrial events of apoptosis following cisplatin treatment, including Bax activation and cytochrome c release. Numerous studies have shown that antioxidants can be used to provide renoprotection by limiting ROS generation negative effects induced by oxidative stress. For example, reducing GSH levels has been shown to be effective at protecting against Pt-drug induced nephrotoxicity. The delivery of antioxidants that target the mitochondria can be used to prevent Pt-drug nephrotoxicity by decreasing toxic oxidative stress injury. A combinatory treatment using ebselen and allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, significantly diminished ROS generation, preventing cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats. Similarly, dimethylthiourea, a hydroxyl radical scavenger, prevented increases to BUN and sCr levels and reduced apoptosis, whilst maintaining ATP content, electrochemical potential, NAPDH and GSH levels following cisplatin administration. Inhibition of the inflammatory response by IL-10 and suppression of TNF α have been shown to protect the kidneys when administering Pt drugs."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Adverse outcome pathways linked to neurotoxicity have not yet been formally described, with the exception of excitotoxicity linked to kainate-type glutamate receptors. However, it is well established that disruption of ion channel function can be an initiating event that leads to neurotoxicity following exposure to a broad variety of compounds. Disruption of ion channel function by chemicals including insecticides such as the pyrethroids, organochlorines, and other chemical classes often leads to alterations in cellular excitability that ultimately result in perturbation of the functioning networks and pathways critical to nervous system homeostasis, resulting in neurotoxic signs and symptoms. The ToxCast assay suite contains twenty binding assays (Novascreen (NVS\\_IC) assays) that measure the interaction of compounds with different ion channels. However, interference with ligand binding does not always equate to disruption of channel function, and the type of disruption produced (agonist, antagonist, modulator) cannot always be determined on the basis of binding alone. Thus, prediction of toxicity solely on the basis of binding results is unreliable. By contrast, rapid and efficient assays that allow assessment of ion channel function also have limitations. For example, highthroughput patch-clamp assays often require that ion channel subunits be expressed in non-neuronal cell models."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

The objective of this study was to leverage commercial immunoassay technology to develop a more efficient H295R assay to measure E2 and T levels in 384-well format. The resulting Homogenous Time Resolved Fluorescence assay platform (H295R-HTRF) was evaluated against a training set of 36 chemicals derived from the OECD inter-laboratory validation study, EPA guideline 890.1200 aromatase assay, and azole fungicides active in the HT-H295R assay. Quality control performance criteria were met for all conditions except E2 synthesis inhibition where low basal hormone synthesis was observed. Five proficiency chemicals were active for both the E2 and T endpoints, consistent with guideline classifications. Of the nine OECD core reference chemicals, 9/9 were concordant with outcomes for E2 and 7/9 for T. Likewise, 9/13 and 11/13 OECD supplemental chemicals were concordant with anticipated effects for E2 and T, respectively."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Azole fungicides\",\"MIE\",\"cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme inhibition\""}]}

This analysis highlights the critical role of interaction distribution in determining protein -ligand binding strength. In ML development, data availability presents a significant hurdle, especially in toxicity assessment. Traditionally, toxicity prediction involved combining in vitro and in vivo studies to evaluate molecule effects on cells or animals.

The overall assessment of this AOP reveals a rather moderate dose-response and temporal concordance between the KEs. There is a good dose-response and temporal concordance between DEHP, oxidative stress, DNA damage, apoptosis, and the oocyte or the follicle number. In murine oocytes, 10 µM DEHP or 20 and 40 µg DEHP/kg bw/day causes DNA damage and apoptosis leading to reduced number of oocytes and follicles. Similarly, 40 µg DEHP/kg bw/day causes oxidative stress, DNA damage, and apoptosis, thus affecting fertilization capabilities of murine oocytes. Moreover, there is an association between DEHP exposure and later KE in this path, such as primary follicle assembly. It can be argued that DEHPmediated apoptotic effect could be the result of a general toxicity; however, studies have shown that apoptosis may either target only one group of cells in the follicle or it may be reversible, which speaks in favor of the specificity of DEHP-mediated apoptotic effect in the ovary. The association between DEHP exposure and the KE 'Increases in the pro-apoptotic protein expression' is somewhat inconsistent and lacks dose-dependent and temporal evidence. DEHP at 20 µg/kg bw/day increases caspase expression and decreases cell proliferation.

After evaluation of the four microglia cell types, hiMG emerges as the preferred model for in vitro assay development due to its cytokine expression patterns in response to LPS, which closely align with those observed in vivo, particularly the upregulation of TNFα and IL-6. Based on these findings, we selected IL-6 and TNFα as biomarkers for developing high-throughput screening assays targeting inflammation-inducing chemicals. 3.2. Development and optimization of high-throughput screening IL-6 and TNFα assays in hiMG cells To develop high-throughput cytokine detection assays, we evaluated the optimal preincubation duration of hiMG cells in 1536-well plates prior to compound treatment because maturation and functional responsiveness of hiMG cells are critical for assay optimization. We examined the effects of LPS on hiMG cells after pre-incubation periods of 2, 3, or 4-days post-seeding. As illustrated in Fig. 3a-c, a 2-day pre-incubation yielded minimal LPS-induced responses.

They found that PFAS exposure was linked to alterations of proteomic profiles, such as reduced inflammation. However, these two proteomics studies focus on the Swedish population with relatively older age groups, leaving a gap in research on young populations from diverse ethnic backgrounds that are historically underrepresented in biomedical research. Furthermore, the scope of these studies is limited as they only examined individual PFAS congeners, whereas humans are exposed to a mixture of correlated PFAS compounds, potentially resulting in synergistic health effects. In our study, we aim to investigate the associations of five individual PFAS congeners and their mixtures with a high-throughput panel of cardiometabolic proteins using Olink. Olink utilizes a novel proximity extension assay technology, which has been validated for technical robustness, demonstrating good reproducibility and stability across multiple studies. Our study included baseline data from (1) the Study of Latino Adolescents at Risk (SOLAR), comprising of Hispanic overweight or obese children, as well as data from (2) the Metabolic and Asthma Incidence Research (Meta-AIR), comprising of young adults with a history of childhood overweight or obesity.

Besides these applications, we are currently enlarging the data basis for signaling pathways known to be crucial for human brain development. Altogether these data will continue to define the biological and toxicological applicability domains of the Neurosphere Assay and hence increase confidence in this valuable assay. To use the results from the Neurosphere Assay in a risk assessment context, the calculated Point of Departure (PoD) values, in our case a benchmark concentration (BMC), need to be translated to an internal dose within the fetal brain. Therefore, reverse physiology-based kinetic modeling (PBK) and quantitative in vitro to in vivo extrapolations (qIVIVE) can be applied. One fundamental input to IVIVE is the determination of the free test compound concentration, which is defined as the concentration of the compound not bound to plastics, protein or lipid. If the nominal concentration is used instead, the uncertainty of the data analysis increases. The internal dose, determined by qIVIVE can then be translated into an external dose which highly depends on the exposure scenario (e.g. oral, dermal) and modeling of the barriers relevant for the respective type of exposure (e.g. oral bioavailability, dermal bioavailability)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Current guideline DNT studies are resource intensive and not amenable to screening large numbers of compounds for hazard. As part of evaluating a battery of more rapid and scalable in vitro assays for DNT hazard, 86 compounds were screened for their ability to alter function during cortical network development. Developing rat cortical networks were treated with a concentration series (usually 0.03-30 m M) of 86 compounds, 60 of which have known in vivo DNT effects ('DNT Reference Set'). Spontaneous network activity was monitored by microelectrode array recordings over 12days in vitro, and 17 measures of network activity and synchrony were quantified. Following recordings on days in vitro 12, in-well cell assessment of metabolic activity (Alamar blue) and total cellular content (lactase dehydrogenase) were conducted. Of the 86 compounds tested, 64 perturbed cortical network function in a concentration-dependent manner; 49 of the 60 DNT Reference Set compounds (81.7%) altered network formation. Compounds were ranked by potency (network effect EC ) and selectivity (separation of network and cell viability EC ) for hazard prioritization."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

The cDNA cloning of an LTB4 receptor, BLT1, showed that BLT1 is a GPCR with seven transmembrane domains with few similarities to known receptors, including those for chemoattractants and prostanoids (10). We and others have successfully cloned cDNA and genomic DNAs of BLT1 from other species, including mouse (11, 12), guinea pig (14, 15), and rat (13), and have shown that the primary structures of BLT1 are conserved among species especially in the TM domains. BLT1 isolated from various animals showed subnanomolar Kd values for 3 H-LTB4 in transfection studies, and the binding was inhibited by a number of specific BLT antagonists. Therefore, BLT1 is a high-affinity receptor for LTB 4. The distribution of BLT1 is restricted, with expression observed almost exclusively in peripheral leukocytes (10, 14), activated macrophages (13), and eosinophils (11). In this manuscript, genomic structure, characterization of the promoter region, and mechanism of cell-specific transcription of the BLT1 gene are reported. The BLT1 gene consists of three exons, and the ORF is intronless like other receptors for chemoattractants such as FMLP (31), IL-8 (32), and platelet-activating factor (PAF ). Owman et al.

For p107, residues 614-630 experienced the strongest reductions in intensity (Fig. 2c). These residues are identical to those previously observed to exhibit reduced intensities with wild-type (WT) B55, confirming not only that p107 binds B55 but also that the B55 PP2Aa binding loop that is missing in B55 LL is dispensable for p107 binding. Similar results were obtained with Eya3. Specifically, in the presence of B55 LL, Eya3 residues 68-83 showed reduced intensities (Fig. 2d), confirming that Eya3 binds directly to B55 LL.

In turn, worsening erythema events may occur with brimonidine use for reasons that are entirely patient dependent and can be allergic (very rarely) or non-allergic (more often) on nature. The worsening phenomenon that occurs in some patients as the effects of brimonidine agonism wane may be explained by receptor desensitization and internalization, negative feedback loops, or activation of other compensatory mediators that lead to vasodilation. Skin barrier dysfunction can increase local concentrations of brimonidine and can be effectively treated with moisturizers prior to brimonidine therapy. In addition, the paradoxical-worsening phenomenon occurring within hours of brimonidine application may be explained by high concentrations of brimonidine within skin that leads to the saturation of receptors and 'spillover' effect to other a -AR subtypes with unwanted effects (vasodilation). Brimonidine effects are predominantly beneficial. We hypothesize that certain individual characteristics may potentially override the vasoconstrictive effect transiently (e.g., barrier dysfunction) or permanently (e.g., receptor polymorphisms).

Another aspect that warrants more consideration is the number of chemicals evaluated by rainbow trout cell lines. The published literature suggests that several dozens of chemicals have been tested for cytotoxicity in RTgill-W1 cells, such as fragrance chemicals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, nanobiomaterials, microplastics, and biocides. However, there is sparse or no representation from notable chemical classes such as pesticides. Further increasing scientific confidence in OECD test guideline 249 will need to consider several factors including how this NAM performs: 1) under certain applicability domains (i.e., exposure to chemicals with diverse physicochemical properties and mechanisms of action); 2) technically with advances to the method, including resource efficiency considerations (e.g., shifting from 24-well to 96-well microplates, using two cell viability endpoints instead of three); and 3) in terms of biological relevance (i.e., how in vitro values compare with those in vivo; responses in RTgill-W1 cells vs. other rainbow trout cell lines). Accordingly, the overall goal of our study was to characterize the cytotoxicity of 19 pesticides with comparable whole animal data, and diverse potencies and mechanisms of action in three rainbow trout cell lines (RTgill-W1, RTL-W1, and RTgutGC). Selected pesticides are of concern in Canadian ecosystems, and include herbicides (aminomethylphosphonic acid [AMPA], atrazine, dicamba, dimethenamid-P, diquat, glyphosate, imazethapyr, metolachlor, S-metolachlor, and metribuzin), insecticides (carbaryl, chlorantraniliprole, chlorpyrifos, clothianidin, diazinon, imidacloprid, permethrin, and thiamethoxam), and a fungicide (chlorothalonil)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"chlorantraniliprole\",\"KE\",\"cytotoxicity in RTgutGC by both viability endpoints\"\n\"dimethenamid-P\",\"KE\",\"cytotoxicity in gill, liver, and gut cell lines\"\n\"metolachlor\",\"KE\",\"cytotoxicity in gill, liver, and gut cell lines\"\n\"S-metolachlor\",\"KE\",\"cytotoxicity in gill, liver, and gut cell lines\"\n\"carbaryl\",\"KE\",\"cytotoxicity in gill, liver, and gut cell lines\"\n\"chlorpyrifos\",\"KE\",\"cytotoxicity in gill, liver, and gut cell lines\"\n\"chlorantraniliprole\",\"KE\",\"cell-line specific cytotoxicity in gut cells\"\n\"atrazine\",\"AO\",\"acute lethality in rainbow trout\"\n\"dimethenamid-P\",\"AO\",\"acute lethality in rainbow trout\"\n\"metolachlor\",\"AO\",\"acute lethality in rainbow trout\"\n\"S-metolachlor\",\"AO\",\"acute lethality in rainbow trout\"\n\"metribuzin\",\"AO\",\"acute lethality in rainbow trout\"\n\"clothianidin\",\"AO\",\"acute lethality in rainbow trout\"\n\"diazinon\",\"AO\",\"acute lethality in rainbow trout\"\n\"imidacloprid\",\"AO\",\"acute lethality in rainbow trout\"\n\"thiamethoxam\",\"AO\",\"acute lethality in rainbow trout\""}]}

Five of the 14 network parameters were not affected by any compound, including number of active electrodes and mean inter-spike interval within bursts. 17 compounds tested negative, e.g., acetaminophen, chlorpyrifos, and its derivate chlorpyrifos-methyl (data not shown). 11 of the 27 pesticides are considered positive, for which at least one network parameter had to be affected without cytotoxic effects at any administered concentration. β-Cyfluthrin, β-cypermethrin, deltamethrin, penthiopyrad, and rotenone evoked effects in more than two parameters, whereas the other six pesticides affected one or two parameters.

Together, these studies suggest that Pt-drug nephrotoxicity and kidney cell death can be ameliorated by targeting a multitude of pharmacologic, molecular, and genetic targets. 3.3. Empirical evidence: dose-response and temporal concordance The cytotoxicity of Pt anticancer agents is generally attributed to their capacity to form DNA adducts. For cisplatin, DNA-adduct formation following exposure was found to be the primary determinant of the magnitude of the response rate observed in a patient population with adducts shown to form quickly and in a dose-dependent manner within 1 -2 h following administration, with a gradual decrease reported over the following 24 h. Escalating doses were also shown to induce a near linear, tissue-dependent increase in intracellular Pt concentrations and DNA adduct formation in vivo. A significant correlation was found between total platinum levels and platinum adduct formation in cultured cells and xenografts following exposure. Doses of 7 mg/kg in nude mouse xenografts and 0.9 -2.7 µ M in vitro showed that platinum peaked at 1 -6 h ( in vitro ) and 3 h ( in vivo ), while maximum adduct formation occurred at 1 hour (cells) and 3 -24 h (xenografts).

Furthermore, although the general organization of brain structures is similar between rodents and humans, a study by Hodge, Bakken highlights significant differences in gene expression among comparable cell types in mouse and human brains. These differences could play a crucial role in explaining the limited success of translating pharmacological treatments for CNS disorders between rodents and humans.

However, there is a need for species that more closely resemble humans in behaviour and brain anatomy for neuropsychiatry and drug discovery research. 8 | Clinical Trial Design and Dosing Strategies Another limitation to the clinical studies is linked to decisions regarding dosage, administration frequency and treatment duration. Unlike animal studies that frequently show robust cognitive effects with acute or subacute dosing of α7 nAChR ligands, many clinical trials have used much longer durations.

Activation of NMDAR triggered an influx of calcium ion, resulting in CREB activation. Similarly, activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway also culminated in CREB activation. Therefore, the co-exposure to DEHP and BPA might suppress CREB activity by concurrently inhibition of NMDAR expression and the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. It is noteworthy that findings on the impacts of co-exposure to DEHP and BPA on CREB activity were inconsistent. For instance, Zhang X et al. found that exposure to DEHP significantly increased CREB phosphorylation induced by binding of estrogen receptors, while co-exposure to DEHP and BPA inhibited the phosphorylation of CREB by DEHP. By contrast, Xiao and colleagues investigated the joint action mode of DEHP and BPA exposure on the development of lung cancer and found that co-exposure to DEHP and BPA activated CREB.

METHODS: The proposed approach combines a text mining (TM) procedure and integrative systems biology to comprehensively analyze the scientific literature to enrich AOPs related to environmental stressors. First, to identify relevant associations between BPS and different AOP components, a list of abstracts was screened using the developed text-mining tool AOP-helpFinder, which calculates scores based on the graph theory to prioritize thefindings. Then, tofill gaps between BPS, biological events, and adverse outcomes (AOs), a systems biology approach was used to integrate information from the AOP-Wiki and ToxCast databases, followed by manual curation of the relevant publications. RESULTS: Links between BPS and 48 AOP key events (KEs) were identified and scored via 31 references. The main outcomes were related to reproductive health, endocrine disruption, impairments of metabolism, and obesity. We then explicitly analyzed co-mention of the terms BPS and obesity by data integration and manual curation of the full text of the publications. Several molecular and cellular pathways were identified, which allowed the proposal of a biological explanation for the association between BPS and obesity.

The widespread use of insecticides may therefore be of concern for (developmental) neurotoxicity in mammals, including humans. Insecticides are commonly classified according to their structure and best-known neurotoxic mode of action. Organochlorine insecticides are generally banned but very persistent and still present in the environment. Organochlorines are subclassified in 2 main groups: 1,1,1-Trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT)-type insecticides that target voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) and chlorinated alicyclic insecticides that target c -Aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine receptors. Pyrethroid insecticides delay the inactivation of VGSCs and thus increase the Na influx, which consequently depolarizes the cell membrane resulting in overexcitation. Organophosphate insecticides are best known for their irreversible inhibition of acetylcholine esterase (AChE), which results in increased levels of ACh and subsequent overexcitation.

Therefore, this study solves this challenge and produces acceptor-substituted enamino carbonyl compounds in high yields. We conducted a rapid assessment of the coupling reaction (see ESI, † rapid assessment of reaction) using Glorius's method. It indicated that the reaction tolerates several functional groups and heterocycles (Table S2 † ). However, terminal alkenes, terminal alkynes, aldehydes, phenols, alkyl chlorides, aryl esters, primary amines, chloropyrimidines, and N -alkyl indoles could retard the formation of enamino carbonyl compounds, and primary amines, chloropyrimidines, and alkyl chlorides may not survive under reaction conditions. Based on these observations, we  rst screened various thioamides in this reaction (Table 2). Compounds 5a -5c contain nitrogen protecting groups that can be easily removed, and the resulting products could be transformed into indolizidine using the transformation shown in Scheme 1 ( 1 into 2 ). Compound 5d contains Ph directly attached to the nitrogen atom increasing the steric hindrance close to the reacting centers (thioamide carbon and sulfur)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Given their key role in the formation of endogenous steroid hormones, enzymes involved in steroidogenesis are considered important targets for endocrine disrupting chemicals. However, the development of in vitro steroidogenesis assays has been a challenge because only adrenal and gonadal cells express appreciable cytochrome P450 side chain cleavage enzyme (CYP11A1), the initial enzyme in the steroid metabolism pathway required to commit cholesterol to a steroid hormone fate by forming pregnenolone (PREG) from cholesterol. CYP11A1 is expressed in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal gland, Leydig cells of the testes, and theca cells of the ovary. Subsequent enzymes involved in steroidogenesis, including CYP17A1 and CYP19A1, are expressed in a variety of tissues including the liver, skin, and the nervous system. To date, no steroidogenically competent in vitro platform has been developed from ovarian cells. Several cell lines have been established from rodent Leydig cells, including R2C, mLTC, and BLTK1 cells for the evaluation of progestagen and androgen levels. The only human-derived, steroidogenically competent cell line is the human adrenocortical H295R cells. The EPA's Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP) has incorporated the OECD validated H295R-based in vitro steroidogenesis assay as part of the Tier 1 screening battery.

In this study, we have attempted to combine the different strategies described above to characterize AOPs which could be linked to BPF isomers. Indeed, biological enrichment of a protein complex (using PPIs) associated with the BPF isomers, literature mining (with AOP-helpFinder and manual curation) and data integration from various sources, allowed to improve our assessment of biological pathways and biological events connected to BPF. By using such a higher-level combination of methods, we were not only able to link BPF to an individual AOP but we were also able to associate these isomers to a complex AOP network. These networks are particularly relevant to represent multiple outcomes of a substance and also of a mixture of substances. By combining different modules of text mining/ scoring and of systems biology approaches, we provide a strategy to accelerate connection of a substance to AOs and identify potential critical steps of its putative mode of action. One advantage of such approaches is the ability to gather disparate types of information (chemical-protein associations, PPIs, protein-signaling pathway annotations) from various sources (literatures, databases), and to integrate them with the aim to identify previously uncharacterized links."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Despite the attention model achieving the highest AUROC and comparable AUPRC, its low MCC of 0.344 indicates less reliable classification consistency. Overall, given the importance of AUPRC and highest MCC, alongside comparable AUROC result, the BiLSTM is the best model choice. As such, we continue to process the AL framework using stack-BiLSTM model. We applied the stack-BiLSTM model to predict outcomes for the pool data set of 1337 compounds using uncertainty, margin, and entropy strategies. In our first round of testing with 215 samples, all three strategies saw a drop in performance when measured by the MCC (Figure 7B).

Neurogenesis during brain development is primarily regulated by the Notch signaling pathway, which is evolutionarily highly conserved and operates at many stages of human brain development. Stimulation of the Notch pathway could be correlated with impaired neuronal differentiation in vivo. In contrast, inhibited Notch signaling is known to accelerate neuronal differentiation in vitro and in vivo. This can be pharmacologically excited by the Notch receptor inhibitor N-[N-(3,5-Difluorophenacetyl)Lalanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT) through blockage of the presenilin-y-secretase complex. Moreover, the Notch pathway is involved in the formation of long-term memory and is thus a putative actuator of developmental disorders. According to our comprehensive transcriptomic analysis, differentiating hNPCs express Notch receptors 1-3. Here we show that similar to our previously published work after 72 h of differentiation, DAPT increases neuronal numbers to 187% and 439% of the respective solvent control at 0.12 and 10 µM DAPT, respectively, after 5 days of differentiation. Of note, the total cell number was not affected, indicating that the increase in neuronal numbers is at the expense of another cell type within the mixed culture ( Figure 4C ). The higher sensitivity of hNPC towards DAPT in this study is possibly due to the longer experimental time.

Microelectrode arrays (MEAs) can be used to detect drug and chemical induced changes in neuronal network function and have been used for neurotoxicity screening. As a proof-of-concept, the current study assessed the utility of analytical ''fingerprinting'' using principal components analysis (PCA) and chemical class prediction using support vector machines (SVMs) to classify chemical effects based on MEA data from 16 chemicals. Spontaneous firing rate in primary cortical cultures was increased by bicuculline (BIC), lindane (LND), RDX and picrotoxin (PTX); not changed by nicotine (NIC), acetaminophen (ACE), and glyphosate (GLY); and decreased by muscimol (MUS), verapamil (VER), fipronil (FIP), fluoxetine (FLU), chlorpyrifos oxon (CPO), domoic acid (DA), deltamethrin (DELT) and dimethyl phthalate (DMP). PCA was performed on mean firing rate, bursting parameters and synchrony data for concentrations above each chemical's EC50 for mean firing rate. The first three principal components accounted for 67.5, 19.7, and 6.9% of the data variability and were used to identify separation between chemical classes visually through spatial proximity. In the PCA, there was clear separation of GABAA antagonists BIC, LND, and RDX from other chemicals."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Muscimol\",\"MIE\",\"GABAA receptor agonism\"\n\"Bicuculline\",\"MIE\",\"GABAA receptor antagonism\"\n\"Lindane\",\"MIE\",\"GABAA receptor antagonism\"\n\"Picrotoxin\",\"MIE\",\"GABAA receptor antagonism\""}]}

The exception was myclobutanil, which was approximately 10-fold higher. Overall, there was strong concordance among the azole fungicides between the two assay formats, with either format capable of identifying these chemicals as generally decreasing steroid hormone output in the H295R model. The EDSP21 workplan seeks to use New Approach Methods (NAMs) to more efficiently prioritize and screen chemicals for hazard potential while reducing vertebrate animal testing. This is, in part, motivated by the potential need to efficiently screen hundreds to thousands of data-poor chemicals across the EDSPUOC. To maximize screening throughput, increase the speed of data generation, and reduce overall cost, existing HTRF commercial assay technology was employed to measure E2 and T levels in the H295R steroidogenesis assay. The fundamental workflow of the H295R-HTRF assay adhered to the validated OECD and EPA test guidelines, employing a 48-h single exposure to test chemical with multiplexed assessment of cytotoxicity and E2 and T analyte concentrations. Protocols for cell culture medium, expansion, cryopreservation, maintenance, and passage number adhered to standard guidance. A range of cell densities were evaluated that encompassed the 2.0-3.0 × 10 cells per ml necessary to achieve a qualitative density of 50-60% at 24 h post-seeding.

The arrangement of the five subunits plays a crucial role in regulating the channel's kinetics, ion conductance and selectivity, while also influencing the pharmacological properties of the ligand binding sites and the channel's preference for specific cations. In heteromeric α4β2 nAChR, acetylcholine (ACh) binds to a primary site at the α4/β2 interface, with both subunits contributing to its pharmacology. In contrast, homomeric α7 receptors contain five identical ligand binding sites, positioned between adjacent α7 subunits, leading to distinct kinetic and desensitization properties  (Figure 1). The endogenous neurotransmitter ACh, along with exogenous agonists like nicotine, binds at the orthosteric binding site located in the extracellular domain of the receptor, positioned between two subunits. In addition, there are allosteric modulatory sites on the nAChR where positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) bind and enhance receptor function. PAMs facilitate agonist binding by inducing conformational changes, lowering the energy barrier for transitioning from a closed to an open state, or stabilizing the open state, thus modulating receptor activity. 2 | Function and Distribution of the Neuronal Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor All neuronal nAChR subtypes share the key feature of being permeable to small monovalent and divalent cations, primarily sodium, potassium and calcium.

These data demonstrate that the EGFR, as a crucial molecule for NPC proliferation, is also functioning in proliferating hiNPCs. The proliferation of hiNPCs was also effectively inhibited by rotenone, an anti-proliferative compound with a known mode of action i.e. inhibition of the mitochondrial complex I of the electron transport chain. Rotenone produced oxidative stress in iPSC-derived neural stem cells and mitochondrial dysfunction in human neural progenitor cells. In the present study, rotenone inhibited the proliferation of hiNPCs in a concentration-dependent manner with the lowest observed effect concentration of 30 nM ( Figure 7E ). In comparison, the proliferation of primary hNPCs was not affected by rotenone in the same concentration range. Rotenone did not cause cytotoxicity in hiNPCs, however as expected from a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor, significantly reduced the mitochondrial activity ( Figure 7F ).

At this stage, cross-study comparison between studies remains difficult due to variations of experimental design, such as species, dose and treatment. Utilisation of AOPs toward regulatory purposes largely depends on the confidence and precision with which they enable the extrapolation of data from lower levels of biological organization to predicted outcomes at higher levels. It also depends on their ability to connect biological effect measurements to their specific causes. This AOP illustrates a potential sequence of key events linking DNA adduct formation, such as that caused by platinum-based anticancer drugs, to tubular necrosis, ultimately leading to kidney failure. Currently, cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin are the three most widely used platinum-based drugs for cancer treatment worldwide. The cytotoxicity of these agents is mainly due to their ability to form DNA adducts by reacting with nucleophilic sites on DNA. When platinum anticancer agents are taken up into the nephron, primarily by the proximal convoluted tubules, they increase intracellular concentrations, triggering a cascade of harmful cellular responses that can lead to tubular necrosis and potentially result in kidney failure. DNA adduct formation triggers numerous cellular processes that cause DNA damage and induce cell cycle arrest by hindering transcription processes to promote mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Platinum-based anticancer drugs\",\"KE\",\"DNA damage\"\n\"Platinum-based anticancer drugs\",\"KE\",\"Mitochondrial dysfunction\"\n\"Platinum-based anticancer drugs\",\"KE\",\"Oxidative stress\"\n\"Platinum-based anticancer drugs\",\"KE\",\"Tubular necrosis\"\n\"Platinum-based anticancer drugs\",\"AO\",\"Kidney failure\"\n\"Platinum-based anticancer drugs\",\"KE\",\"Cell cycle arrest\"\n\"Platinum-based anticancer drugs\",\"MIE\",\"Pt-DNA adduct formation\"\n\"Carboplatin\",\"KE\",\"Lower adduct formation rate; higher concentration required for nephrotoxicity\"\n\"Oxaliplatin\",\"MIE\",\"DNA adduct formation at same DNA sites (DACH-Pt adducts)\"\n\"Platinum-based anticancer drugs\",\"KE\",\"Tubular obstruction\"\n\"Platinum-based anticancer drugs\",\"KE\",\"Cell death\"\n\"Platinum-based anticancer drugs\",\"KE\",\"Cell detachment and luminal deposition\""}]}

More specifically, the evaluation of conazole fungicides revealed distinguishable profiles of hormone effects for triazole versus imidazole conazoles illustrating the influence of chemical structure on bioactivity. Furthermore, the profiling results highlight a multitude of possible targets that can result in different effects on hormone levels evident in 401 out of the 514 chemicals that elicited concentration-dependent effects on at least one hormone. For example, increased progestagen levels in coordination with decreased androgen and estrogen levels were observed with CYP17A1 inhibition by PRO. Other observed profiles included the decrease of androgen levels with concurrent increases in estrogens suggesting increased aromatase (CYP19A1) activity or decreased estrogen turnover by sulfotransferases. Future studies will seek to characterize the profiles identified, to screen additional chemicals in CR, and to develop in silico predictive models to identify chemicals targeting steroidogenesis.

Moreover, in the present study, marked inhibition of T cell migration was achieved at far lower RO, 10-40%, suggesting that maximal RO is not necessary for the antifibrotic effects mediated by AD-214. Notably, a concentration of 1 nM AD-214 was sufficient to completely inhibit T cell migration and at 0.1 nM achieved 50% inhibition of migration. This is important because 1 nM of AD-214 was found to be the serum concentration after 72 h following a 10 mg/kg IV infusion in the Phase 1 clinical study. When extrapolated to the extended RO levels achieved in the Phase 1 trials for AD-214, these data are supportive of dosing 10-20 mg/kg weekly or every second week via IV administration.

Furthermore, we found that PFAS exposure was associated with alterations of proteins involved in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway in both cohorts.

Carboplatin is also nephrotoxic, albeit to a much lesser extent compared to cisplatin due to its increased stability. Nephrotoxicity has been reported in patients treated with intraperitoneal carboplatin, high-dose carboplatin, or in combination with other drugs, with AKI also shown to occur within days and often being only partially reversible. The third-generation Pt drug oxaliplatin was developed to address the toxicity issues associated with both cisplatin and carboplatin. Oxaliplatin possesses a Pt complex with (1 R,2 R)-1,2-diaminocyclohexane (DACH) ligand and oxalate functioning as a leaving group. The bidentate oxalate considerably decreases the reactivity of oxaliplatin, limiting toxicity. However, oxaliplatin can still induce proximal tubular cell damage yet to a lesser extent, and has been reported to cause kidney tubular vacuolization and acidosis. Despite the reduced incidence of nephrotoxicity, carboplatin and oxaliplatin, along with cisplatin, have all been implicated in the induction of AKI and thrombotic microangiopathy. The objective of the present study was to develop an AOP by way of a literature review and assess causality based on the Bradford Hill criteria. This review provides detailed mechanistic descriptions and evidence for each KE and key event relationships (KERs), discusses the biological plausibility, essentiality of KEs, and empirical evidence related to dose-response and temporal concordance.

Tipping points are one method for determining the adaptive vs adverse responses, and in the present case, the tipping points represent the concentration at which development of network function no longer proceeds according to its normal trajectory in vitro. Although speculative, an additional point to consider in the present study is whether or not the ' adaptive ' responses just below the tipping points (concentrations at which ' recovery ' is observed), might also ultimately lead to adverse responses. The importance of electrical activity in development of the nervous system is well established. Further, the timing of electrical activity during nervous system development is also crucial, and delays in electrical activity have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as attention-deficit hyper activity syndrome. Thus, the possibility exists that even in cases where some recovery of network activity to normal response levels occurs, the excursion out of normal parameters may disrupt the timing of other important event sequences, resulting in latent or delayed effects on nervous system function. Such effects may only become apparent later in life or only when the nervous system is challenged in a way that uncovers the deficit. Of note, the present experiments stopped on DIV 12, and that network function was not assessed or challenged after this time."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

CsA has a proinflammatory effect on the microvascular endothelium and iNOS may participate in this effect: CsA treatment of human intestinal microvascular endothelial cells increased their binding to leukocytes, and this is associated with the inhibition of iNOS. The fact that CsA induces dysfunction in intestinal endothelial cells may help explain why it is not effective as a long-term treatment for chronically active inflammatory bowel disease. Thus, CsA may induce endothelial cell inflammation by blocking iNOS. In addition, Shihab et al. showed that the kidneys of rats with chronic CsA nephrotoxicity exhibit upregulation of VEGF and its KDR/Flk-1 receptor, and that this is elevated by a co-treatment that blocks NOS activity. Conversely, the CsA-induced increase in VEGF expression is suppressed by co-treatment with -arginine, which increases NOS activity. Thus, CsA increases renal production of VEGF by blocking NOS. These studies show that the NO pathway plays an important role in ameliorating CsA-associated vasoconstriction, thereby attenuating CsA nephrotoxicity. However, there is controversy in thefield. Some studies show that by reducing NO levels, CsA blocks the ability of NO to maintain vascular tone. As a result, nephrotoxicity occurs readily. By contrast, other studies show that NO synthesis is enhanced during CsA nephrotoxicity, and this counterbalances the predominantly preglomerular vasoconstriction. This controversy has not yet been discussed in the literature but it certainly suggests that NO participates in CsAinduced renal injury in complex ways."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"Extracellular matrix protein synthesis upregulated in mesangial cells\""}]}

However, it can be difficult to clearly discriminate the effects of mtDNA damage from the nDNA damage, and their relative contribution to toxicity also varies with the mitochondrial content and the cell type studied. Pt-DNA adduct formation triggers numerous cellular processes that induce cell cycle arrest, hinders transcription, and promotes apoptosis resulting in cell death and, without intervention, kidney failure. Following their entry into the cell, Pt agents initiate their mechanism of action by hydrolysing their chloride or oxalate ions, a process facilitated by the low intracellular chloride concentrations (4 -20 mM) compared to the bloodstream ( ≈ 100 mM). For cisplatin, the chlorine ligands are replaced with water, resulting in the formation of electrophilic intermediates making it more reactive to cellular targets (Fig. 3). Unlike cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin feature chelating ligands that are hydrolysed much slower, increasing their stability (Table 2). Following hydrolysis, positively charged Pt reactive species covalently bind to cytoplasmic nucleophiles, such as glutathione (GSH), methionine and other cysteine-rich proteins within DNA to form adducts by Sn2-like mechanisms. Cisplatin-treated salmon sperm DNA showed that Pt links to N7 atoms of guanine and adenine nucleobases to form monofunctional and bifunctional adducts. Most of these adducts occurred on the same strands of DNA, as either GpG 1,2 (60 -65 %) or ApG (20 -25 %) intrastrands."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Cisplatin\",\"KE\",\"Binding to N7 of guanine/adenine; mono- and bifunctional adducts\"\n\"Cisplatin\",\"KE\",\"Aquation (chloride ligand replacement) producing reactive intermediates\"\n\"Oxaliplatin\",\"KE\",\"Transport mechanism (OCT2/MATE2)\""}]}

Dendritic cells and other antigen-presenting cells (APCs) mediate the phagocytosis by extracting antigens from material digested in phagosomes for presentation to lymphocytes, thereby contributing to the activation of T cells and the initiation of adaptive immune responses. Similarly, disruptions in dendritic cell homoeostasis have been implicated in various human inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Thus, our findings provide additional evidence at the cellular level, suggesting the potential immunoenhancement toxicity of PFAS in humans through the activation of cellular immune responses. Previous epidemiological studies found that PFAS exposure was associated with adverse bone outcomes, such as reduced bone mineral density in children, adolescents, and adults, as well as increased osteoporosis in women. In our study, we identified concordant positive associations of PFAS exposure with several proteins related to bone metabolism, such as ACP5, SPP1, CLEC5A, DKK3, and GDF2. Specifically, PFAS mixtures was positively associated with ACP5 and SPP1 in both cohorts. ACP5, also known as tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), is an osteoclastic enzyme involved in bone matrix degradation and serves as a good serum marker for bone resorption. Studies have shown an inverse relationship between levels of TRAPb and bone mineral density in postmenopausal women, as well as a significantly elevated levels of TRAPb in women with osteoporosis compared to controls."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"PFAS\",\"AO\",\"Adverse bone outcomes (reduced BMD, increased osteoporosis)\"\n\"PFAS mixtures\",\"KE\",\"↑ ACP5 and ↑ SPP1 (bone metabolism proteins)\""}]}

KE4: immune cell activation Diclofenac adducts are sensed by APC and other phagocytic cells and trigger immune responses. The immune-mediated hepatitis is the result of complex interplay of innate and adaptive immune responses and involves the regulation of various cytokines/chemokines and their receptors. In specific, the released chemokines recruit the neutrophils, leukocytes and B lymphocytes to the sinusoidal space or to harmed hepatocytes, while cytokines endorse differentiation of myeloid and cytotoxic CD 8+ T-cells. Increased expressions of interleukins modulate the activation and proliferation of T and/or NK cell responses while members of the interleukin-1 superfamily stimulate the production of type 2 cytokines by T-helper cells. Thus, diclofenac treatment resulted in an activation of several cytokines to affect T cell differentiation. Collectively, diclofenac stimulated an activation of diverse immune cells including monocytes, Kupffer cells and APC.

Connectivity and coordination of neural networks are key to fundamental cognitive processes such as attention, learning, and memory. An assay that directly measures successful formation of neural networks may therefore be advantageous to identify potential developmental neurotoxicants. To this end, we recently developed an assay for network development based on microelectrode array (MEA) recordings of primary rat cortical neurons over 12days in vitro (DIV). We previously demonstrated proof of concept for this approach by testing 5 compounds chosen for their ability to disrupt normal cortical development and/or network formation and 1 negative control compound. This study demonstrated the assay's ability to discriminate between positive and negative control compounds in at least 16 measures of network activity, identify concentrations at which network failure begins when testing in a concentration-response scheme, and identify selective network perturbations versus nonspecific cytotoxic effects when coupled with terminal cell death assays. Together, these features facilitate chemical prioritization on the basis of potency and selectivity of network developmental effects. The goal of the current study was 2-fold: first, to demonstrate that the throughput of this assay is amenable to screening compounds and second, to evaluate the ability of the assay to detect known neurodevelopmental toxicants on the basis of neural network disruption. Thus, we used this network formation assay to test 86 unique compounds, representing a broad range of DNT mechanisms and possible molecular initiating events."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

In HL-60 cells (both differentiated and nondifferentiated), this region appears to be partially methylated. Northern blotting of these cell lines showed that HL-60, U937, and THP-1 cells express BLT1 mRNA, whereas HeLa and HepG2 cells do not (Fig. 5 D). These results led us to the conclusion that methylation inhibits BLT1 transcription. Thus, the effect of methylation on the promoter activity was investigated. The insert of p( 2 123/ 1 91) was treated with SssI methylase, which methylates cytosine residues at the CpG sites, and a luciferase assay was performed. The activity of methylated construct was decreased to z 15% of that of the unmethylated construct (Fig. 6), supporting the conclusion that methylation of the CpG sites inhibits the BLT1 promoter activity. LTB4 is a potent activator of granulocytes, eosinophils, and macrophages. The biological activities of LTB 4 are comparable to those of IL-8 and FMLP, so-called 'classical chemoattractants' (25). LTB4 is unique because it is a lipid mediator biosynthesized from membrane phospholipids by the actions of phospholipase A 2 (26, 27), 5-lipoxygenase, and LTA4 hydrolase (2, 28). The actions of LTB4 are believed to be mediated by a specific cell surface receptor, BLT (29)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Various types of phthalate diesters can induce diverse e GLYPH<11> ects. For instance, reproductive toxicity is related to the side chain length of phthalates. Phthalate diesters with a side chain length of C4-6, such as DEHP, DBP or BBzP, are able to interfere with reproductive health. The dose of phthalates can also be the source of conflict in results.

In contrast, some studies are showing that phthalates induced linear toxicity. For example, Ha et al. observed that with the increasing dose of DEHP in Sprague-Dawley rats, levels of testosterone, FSH and LH decreased.

Tac-related neurotoxicity, mediated by elevated blood concentrations of Tac, produces headache, tremor, delirium, and peripheral neuropathy. In a large prospective study, significant neurological undesirable events were correlated with high plasma levels in > 50% patients. Metabolic investigations involving the whole brain of Tac-exposed mice are relatively rare. Hence, more research is warranted in this area to supplement what is known about Tac-mediated toxicity and its related mechanisms in major organs. Herein, Tac-exposed mice showed alterations in aminomalonic acid, scyllo-inositol, dihydromorphine, myoinositol, and 11-octadecenoic acid. Aminomalonic acid strongly inhibits L-asparagine synthase activity, and is up-regulated in the urine of anxiety and major depressive disorders-diagnosed individuals. Multiple metabolomic investigations also revealed that altered serum aminomalonic acid concentration was closely correlated with neuropsychiatric disorders, ketamine overdose, and aortic aneurysm, thus forming a link between aminomalonic acid and various diseases and toxicities. This study revealed that aminomalonic acid can serve as a potential indicator of Tac-mediated neurotoxicity. Scyllo-inositol improves brain cognitive function, reverses memory deficits, and minimizes amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaque within brains of mice.

Therefore, the toxicity of these pyrethroids in vitro seems to be more related to the presence of methyl groups in the cyclopropane ring (see Fig. 1). In conclusion, the five pyrethroids tested, except Fev, only weakly increased the frequency of MN. Nevertheless, as weak genotoxicity is difficult to demonstrate, more studies using an extended number of donors and different culture schedules as well as different source, isomer composition and purity of the pesticides, are required. A clear linear dose-dependent cytotoxic effect was found with all of the pesticides tested; this linearity could be accurately measured by means of the newly introduced cytokinesis block proliferation index.

On the other hand, both NDI and CBPI were reduced in a linear manner with increasing concentrations of the five pesticides. The ANOVA showed no significant difference between correlation coefficients calculated for NDI and CBPI but both indexes were significantly different from the correlation coefficients calculated for the percentage of BN cells (P < 0.01).

Receptors for cytokines and growth factors, such as transforming growth factor (TGF), stimulate the MAPK signaling pathway. Most of the signaling pathways interconnected with steroid signaling are associated with the metabolism and regulation of cell proliferation and cell death. NFκ B creates a group of transcription factors that are involved in various biological processes, including immune response, inflammation, cell growth, survival, and development. These intracellular pathways can mediate steroid hormones action on cell proliferation (cellular multiplication, which leads to the growth of cell population) and of apoptosis (genetically programmed cell death). Two di GLYPH<11> erent pathways stimulate apoptosis. Intrinsic pathway (or mitochondrial pathway) of apoptosis occurs through the activation of caspases-enzymes catalyzing the cleavage of the cell proteins. The external pathway is activated by an external 'death' signal bound to the tumor necrosis factor receptor, which activates caspases. Steroids, but also some peptide hormones and other factors, regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis (see Table 1). Table 1.

Therefore, with regard to toxicological valuation of pyrethroids additional factors such as chemical impurities, source as well as manufacturing process and isomer composition should be taken into consideration. Five pyrethroids (fenvalerate, deltamethrin, cypermethrin, permethrin, cyfluthrin) differing in their chemical purity were investigated on their cytotoxic effects, especially on their ability to induce mitotic cell division disturbances using Chinese hamster lung cells of line V79. The colony forming ability (CFA) resulted in distinct differences of the cytotoxic effect of the tested pyrethroids, whereby permethrin was found to be most toxic. With the exception of fenvalerate all tested pyrethroids gave rise to inhibition of cell cycle progression as shown by G2: M-arrest of synchronized V79 cells by flow cytometry as well as by the increase of the mitotic index as evaluated by light microscopy. The mitotic arresting activity could be attributed to the occurrence of abnormal mitotic figures such as initial and full C-metaphases. The results however indicate, that pyrethroids per se do not contribute to the cytotoxic effects but that other factors such as chemical impurities, source as well as manufacturing process and isomer composition may be responsible for the observed cytotoxic effects. © 1999 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Barnes, M.J. Janssen, Huan Yang, F.A. Redegeld, R. Masereeuw The kidneys are susceptible to chemical-induced injury from various compounds, such as drugs and heavy metals, primarily due to physiological factors that lead to high xenobiotic exposure. The kidneys receive approximately 25 % of cardiac output, ensuring a high delivery rate of toxicants. Additionally, the kidneys ' ability to concentrate solutes further increases this exposure. Within the kidney, proximal tubule cells exhibit heightened sensitivity to xenobiotic toxicity. They are responsible for the reabsorption of most nutrients and low molecular weight proteins, and approximately 70 % of filtered solutes and water. Furthermore, they utilise active transporters to eliminate toxic side products and drug compounds from the blood. Uptake of these solutes takes place at the basolateral side of the proximal tubule cells. Upon entering the cells, these compounds are secreted at the apical side into the luminal filtrate, leaving the body with the urine. The toxicity of many xenobiotics is directly related to their exposure to proximal tubule cells, their uptake via transport proteins like the SLC22A2/organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2), reactivity within the cytoplasm, and secretion through efflux transporters like multi-antimicrobial extrusion protein transporter-1 (MATE1) and multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs). Acute or chronic damage to the proximal tubule cells often results in acute tubular necrosis (ATN), potentially leading to kidney failure."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Guimara es * ABSTRACT: Equine-chorionic gonadotropin (eCG) is widely used in fixed-time artificial ovulation and superovulation protocols to improve reproductive performance. Commercial products available in the market for veterinary use consist of partially purified preparations of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG). eCG is a heterodimeric glycoprotein and is thus extremely challenging to quantify through chromatography. Pharmaceutical companies usually carry out in vivo methods to measure the potency of finished products containing eCG. Considering the three Rs principle (refinement, replacement, and reduction), the aim of this study was to develop in vitro assays using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and cell culture techniques to predict the biological activity of products containing sı eCG. The experimental conditions established for the chromatographic method allowed an efficient separation between the eCG peaks and the excipients present in the formulation, with a consistent chromatographic profile between batches of eCG-products and the analytical standard (PMSG). In cell culture, stimulation of MA-10 cells with both PMSG and products containing eCG resulted in significant progesterone production in all tested concentrations and a similar profile between the products and control, indicating substantial biological activity."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Equine-chorionic gonadotropin\",\"KE\",\"Progesterone production\"\n\"Equine-chorionic gonadotropin\",\"KE\",\"Increased progesterone production in MA-10 cells\"\n\"Equine-chorionic gonadotropin\",\"KE\",\"Progesterone ≥10-fold vs control\"\n\"Equine-chorionic gonadotropin\",\"KE\",\"Minimal effect on MA-10 cell viability\"\n\"Equine-chorionic gonadotropin\",\"AO\",\"Ovulation induction / estrus synchronization\"\n\"Equine-chorionic gonadotropin\",\"KE\",\"Increased ovarian weight (in vivo potency endpoint)\""}]}

Generally speaking, the smaller the value of the binding free energy, the higher the affinity of the ligand and the more stable the binding to the receptor. It could be seen that the binding free energy of bifenthrin to the receptor was GLYPH<0> 35.66 kcal/mol compared to GLYPH<0> 38.61 kcal/mol for permethrin, indicating that the binding of permethrin was much more stable, which was consistent with the RMSD results. This result was probably related to the greater number of polar amino acid residues around the permethrin which generated a stronger van der Waals interaction. Though the trifluoromethyl group of bifenthrin, as a polar group, might also generate electrostatic forces with the surrounding polar amino acids, this interaction obviously did not contribute as much as the van der Waals interaction to the overall binding free energy, which was also evident from the energy components. In both systems, van der Waals forces served as the main driving force for ligand binding, electrostatic interaction and non-polar solvation also made some contribution to the stability of binding, while polar solvent solvation was the main inhibitory force for binding."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Panelists from the 2017 FIFRA SAP review of the AR pathway model suggested that a similar approach to reduce the number of assays required for the AR pathway model would be useful. In this paper, we report the results of a similar procedure for the AR pathway model, using an updated, full AR model evaluated using AR in vitro and in vivo reference chemicals previously published. Here, however, the full biologically based network structure is used for constructing the minimal assay models, rather than the linear data fitting strategy used with ER. The method used here is computationally intensive, and at the time the ER subset model was developed, the approach used here was not computationally tractable. Additionally, we developed both agonist and antagonist minimal assay models, the latter because AR antagonist activity is more prevalent among xenobiotic chemicals than is agonist activity, which has been previously observed for only a small set of steroid hormones and pharmaceutical chemicals. The in vitro reference chemicals were previously developed by an ICCVAM working group and reported by Kleinstreuer et al."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Both microcephaly and megalencephaly may result in severe neurological disabilities such as global developmental delay, seizures, deficits in language development and social interactions. Neurospheres are valuable 3D test systems to study NPC proliferation since they are highly proliferative in suspension culture in the presence of growth factors. For our specific neurosphere test system (Lonza, Verviers, Belgium), expression of the cell type-specific CNS neural stem and progenitor cell markers nestin and SRY-box 2 (SOX2) in proliferating hNPCs was confirmed ( Figure 2D ). Nestin is an intermediatefilament protein type IV used as a molecular marker for neuroepithelial stem cells and CNS progenitors. When human multipotent CNS progenitors differentiate into neurons and glial cells, nestin expression is rapidly downregulated in vivo confirming its usefulness as a neural progenitor cell marker. SOX proteins comprise a group of transcription factors conserved throughout evolution. SOX2 is a marker for proliferating CNS progenitors and its overexpression inhibits neuronal differentiation. The primary hNPCs used in this study were double-positive for nestin and SOX2 as shown in Figure 2D."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

The positive effect of Notch inhibition on neuronal differentiation is thought to be - at least in part - attributed to suppression of the Rho GTPase RhoA. Consistent with this notion, narciclasine, an activator of RhoA, reduced neuronal differentiation of primary hNPCs cultured for 5 days in a concentration-dependent manner, together with a less sensitive reduction of the nuclei number ( Figures 4D,E adapted from Masjosthusmann et al. ). Increased RhoA activity correlated with reduced neuronal differentiation of murine neural stem cells and human iPSCs. In contrast, inactivated RhoA signaling was sufficient to stimulate axon regeneration and recovery of hindlimb function after spinal cord injury in mice supporting the concept of RhoA activity as an inhibitory driver of neurogenesis. Besides the generation of adequate neuronal numbers during neurogenesis, neuronal maturation, especially neurite outgrowth, and branching are equally important for the functional maturation of the CNS. Perturbations of which are assumed to be linked to neurodevelopmental disorders like autism spectrum disorder in humans. The NPC4 assay measuring neurite outgrowth builds upon the neuronal differentiation assay (NPC3) and evaluates the neurite morphology within the multicellular differentiated neurosphere culture. After AI-based identification of β (III)tubulin + neurons, their morphological features, e.g. neurite length and neurite area, are evaluated ( Figure 4F ) using the Omnisphero software."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"narciclasine\",\"KE\",\"reduced neuronal differentiation\"\n\"DAPT\",\"KE\",\"increased neuronal numbers\""}]}

The observed hypoactivity in developing C. elegans may be related to reported 5FU-induced muscle impairment and HU-induced post-exposure effects on locomotion parameters in mammals. In contrast to 5FU and HU-induced hypoactivity, RV was associated with a nonsignificant trend to slight hyperactivity in both exposure schemes. Continuous RV exposures induced delays to sequential developmental milestones that increased with exposure duration. RV-induced delays were significantly reduced but not eliminated in early-only exposure cohorts, consistent with cumulative RV effects on developmental progress. These findings suggest that C. elegans may be a useful model for detecting chemicals with irreversible, reversible, and/or cumulative effects on organismal development. * Corresponding author.

Comparative data analysis to HT-H295R Ten azole fungicides active for E2 and/or T biosynthesis inhibition in the HT-H295R assay variant were evaluated as part of the training set. None of the chemicals were observed to increase E2 or T levels, consistent with prior reporting (Table 5). In the H295R-HTRF assay, 7/10 chemicals were concordant for decreased E2 with three exceptions noted (cyproconazole, myclobutanil, triadimefon). ACC values for the active chemicals were generally equivalent or less potent than the ACC values in the HT-H295R assay and not confounded by cytotoxicity. As expected, BMD values were lower than the ACC values and more in line with the ACC values in the HTH295R assay. None of the seven chemicals met the OECD efficacy threshold but 5/7 were statistically significant. Only one chemical (triadimefon) was considered statistically significant (equivocal) but not identified by TCPL analysis. Regarding T biosynthesis, 8/10 chemicals recapitulated bioactivity classifications from the HT-H295R assay. Four of the active chemicals (tebuconazole, triadimefon, triadimenol, triflumizole) also met the OECD efficacy and statistical significance criteria.

Although arteritis of cardiac arteries, hypertension, renal vasoconstriction and reduced nitric oxide formation are potential mechanisms of Tac-mediated toxicity, the true underlying mechanism remains undetermined. In this study, no specific metabolite alterations were observed in the heart tissue, although a marked increase in acetone may be suggestive of Tac-induced toxicity. The heart requires massive energy, and a constant supply of glucose, lipids, and amino acids to generate ATP to sustain a healthy heart beat. Markedly elevated concentrations of ketone bodies like acetone points to the impairment of the TCA cycle, and a switch from glucose oxidation to β oxidation of fatty acids indicates dysregulation within the energy metabolism. Liver is essential for glycogen storage, protein synthesis, and detoxification. Emerging evidences suggest that Tac exposure elicits liver damage, and the hepatocytes form a ground-glass appearance, which is an early indicator of Tac toxicity. In terms of the biochemical indexes, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin are established markers of hepatic lesion. Tac is reported to accelerate cholestasis by suppressing biliary excretion of glutathione. Herein, the authors demonstrated marked elevation of L-sorbose, palmitic acid, myo-inositol, and uridine in the hepatic tissue. Among these metabolites, palmitic acid concentration was previously reported to be elevated during hepatotoxicity in drug toxicity-based investigations.

Indeed, there is a body of evidence that indicates changes in the rate of neurodevelopment alter functional outcomes. It will be important for future studies to challenge these recovered neural networks to examine the lasting impact of developmental exposures. It should be pointed out that the assay as performed does not attempt to 'wash out' compounds prior to assessment. Thus, the possibility cannot be discounted that some of the False positive rate observed effects are due to acute actions of the compounds on network activity at the time of measurement, as opposed to a developmental effect on network formation. From the standpoint of a screening approach, making such a distinction is, in our opinion, of lower priority than determining alterations in activity for several reasons. First, the data suggest that for a number of compounds, the effects following exposure during network development are different than acute effects. This includes lindane and dieldrin, which increased MFR following acute exposure but here decreased MFR over the 12-day exposure period. For TPHP and TTDCIPP, decreases in MFR (IC values of approximately 16 l M) were reported by Behl et al. However, in the present study, IC values for MFR were not able to be determined for these compounds, and other parameters were altered at approximately 9 and 0.09 l M, respectively."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"TPHP\",\"KE\",\"Altered network parameters during development\"\n\"Lindane\",\"KE\",\"Decreased mean firing rate over developmental exposure\"\n\"Dieldrin\",\"KE\",\"Decreased mean firing rate over developmental exposure\""}]}

However, its efficient window is quite narrow, and it is challenging to sustain target Tac concentration in the blood. In clinical settings, even with Tac concentrations within therapeutic range, some patients experience rejection or toxicity. Hence, anorexia and organ toxicity are common occurrences. The major adverse reactions from Tac include nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, diabetogenesis, gastrointestinal disturbances, and hypertension. These adverse effects are usually dose-dependent. Unfortunately, despite multiple investigations on Tac and numerous hypotheses on its meschanisms, including Tac's metabolite-related toxicity, accelerated apoptosis, and augmented inflammation, the true mechanism behind Tac-mediated toxicity remains undetermined. Metabolomics is a robust analytical strategy that identifies global complexity and important alterations in metabolites. This technique provides overall metabolic profiling parameters in biological systems, and it is optimal for metabolic investigations. Our prior metabolomic investigations, using gas chromatography -mass spectrometry (GC-MS), identified numerous metabolites, which revealed alterations in metabolism under pathophysiological conditions. Hence, it is essential to examine Tac-mediated toxicity. In prior investigations, Tac toxicity was examined by analyzing metabolic changes in target tissues like the serum, urine, heart, lung, and kidney. Nevertheless, a systematic evaluation of Tac-driven toxicity in several biological systems is urgently needed.

Likewise, egl19, which is expressed in pharyngeal and body muscles, was significantly up-regulated at 5 mg L deltamethrin, and unc -2, which is required in the HSNs and/or VCs to negatively regulate egg-laying, was significantly up-regulated at 0.05 mg L.

Both negative and positive velocity values along the concentration curve (indicating both recovery and non-recovery trajectories) also were required to identify a critical concentration.

The concentration at the last V =0crossing point of the velocity derivative (going from negative to positive) was then taken as the critical concentration. If multiple V =0 crossings occurred, the greater concentration was selected as the critical concentration to be more conservative in estimating compound effects. Uncertainty in the critical concentration value was estimated by randomly leaving out one replicate for each concentration of a compound and estimating a new critical concentration for the incomplete dataset using the above-described method.

In the promoter analysis using the mutated Bdnf-pIV, we found that CRE is involved in the DM-induced activation of Bdnf-pIV. Other factors could also be involved because CaRE3m was not enough to reduce the activation. ERK/MAPK pathway induces the phosphorylation of CREB at Ser133, which can recruit the CREBbinding protein (CBP) to activate CRE-dependent transcription. However, it has recently become evident that TORC (transducer of regulated CREB) is dephosphorylated by calcineurin and then transported from the cytoplasm to the nucleus to activate CRE-dependent transcription independently of the phosphorylation of Ser133. Supporting this idea, the calcineurin pathway is involved in the control of DM-induced Bdnf eIV-IX mRNA expression, in addition to the ERK/MAPK pathway. In this study, however, it is still unclear how the calcineurin and ERK/MAPK pathways cooperate to control the DM-induced transcription of Bdnf-pIV through CREB.

Functions of the major signaling pathways in cyclosporine A-induced nephrotoxicity. On CsA treatment, the ERK1/2 pathway in kidney cells becomes highly activated; this increases transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) due to the induction of claudin-1 expression. These pathways decrease the paracellular permeability of kidney cells. ERK1/2 also activates ROS and oxidative stress and promotes CsA-induced glomerular dysfunction and the subsequent nephrotoxicity. EGFinduced activation of p38 ameliorates CsA-induced activation of Smad and apoptosis. The vasoactivity of NO plays a key role in maintaining vascular tone. CsA inhibits NO synthesis and induces vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), thereby increasing renal arterial pressure. Conversely, CsA also enhances NO levels by increasing eNOS mRNA expression and inhibits the expression of endothelin-1, thereby counterbalancing preglomerular vasoconstriction. While NFκ B contributes to CsA nephrotoxicity, the NFκ B pathway mediates the ability of Klotho expression to ameliorate the nephrotoxicity of CsA. TGFβ 1 is afibrogenic cytokine; its expression is induced by ERK1/2 and this contributes to CsA-induced renalfibrosis. p38 increases TGFβ 1-induced TER. The TGFβ 1/IL-2/COX-2 pathway is involved in CsA-induced renal tubular atrophy and interstitialfibrosis.

AOPs delineate the mechanistic link between a molecular initiating event (MIE), and the subsequent intermediate steps, termed key events (KEs), across varying biological levels, ultimately resulting in an adverse outcome (AO). The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has adopted AOPs to facilitate a paradigm shift from traditional animal testing toward predicting toxicity through detailed mechanistic information to improve chemical safety assessment. To promote this approach, the OECD has published guidance on developing, assessing, and reporting AOPs and their use in Integrated Approaches to Testing and Assessment (IATA). A comprehensive understanding of chemical and drug-induced adverse effects is crucial for developing human-relevant, animal-free safety testing methods. This AOP details the sequence of KEs that connect DNA adduct formation to kidney failure, using platinum (Pt)-based chemotherapeutics as a case-example. These chemotherapeutics are commonly employed as anticancer agents for the effective treatment of multiple cancer types, including breast, cervical, oesophageal, bladder, small cell lung and testicular cancer, and can serve as chemical stressors in the described pathway. At present, cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin are the three most widely used Pt-based drugs used globally for the treatment of cancer, all possessing a similar chemical structure consisting of platinum, carrier and leaving groups, undergoing similar mechanisms of cytotoxicity."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Cisplatin\",\"AO\",\"Kidney failure\"\n\"Carboplatin\",\"MIE\",\"DNA adduct formation\""}]}

This study also demonstrated that including both overall network activity and network coordination measures are important for stratifying compound concentration-dependent effects. However, these conclusions were based on testing only 5 compounds (acetaminophen was excluded because it produced no network effects) and effects on cell viability were not excluded from the analysis. Therefore, the much larger data set here provided an opportunity to revisit these questions in the context of a more diverse set of chemical perturbations and an additional network parameter (normalized mutual information).

A recent study also showed that oxidative stress combined with mitochondrial damage plays an important role in CsA hepatotoxicity. Second, there is evidence that the induction of CsA nephropathy involves endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which is closely connected to oxidative stress. This notion is supported by the fact that renal-transplant patients who are treated with CsA exhibit upregulation of an ER stress marker, immunoglobulinbinding protein, in kidney-transplant biopsies. Notably, CsA-induced ER stress also triggers phenotypic changes that resemble the EMT and apoptotic death in human tubular cells both in vivo and in vitro; both of these phenomena have been implicated previously to participate in CsA nephrotoxicity. Third, CsA-induced apoptosis in renal tubular cells relates to oxidative damage and mitochondrialfission. Notably, reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been implicated in CsA nephrotoxicity. Fourth, as well as increasing oxidative stress, CsA treatment also greatly decreases the antioxidant capacity of the kidneys. This could sensitize the kidneys to various stresses, thus making them more susceptible to nephrotoxic agents. Another important mechanism that may underlie CsA nephrotoxicity is autophagy. Although studies on the role of autophagy in CsA nephrotoxicity started only 10 years ago, the evidence to date suggests that autophagy plays very complicated functions in CsA nephrotoxicity. On one hand, it appears that autophagy protects renal tubular cells from CsA-induced nephrotoxicity.

These studies support the usefulness of the 3D hNPC test system for assessing the effects of compounds on NPC proliferation. Fetal cortex development is characterized by different migratory processes mainly involving radial glia cells (RG) and neurons. Human RG exhibit two distinct functions, which are prerequisites for cortex development, especially the higher organization of the human brain: 1) due to their self-renewing capacity, RG increase the cortical cell pool before terminally differentiating into neurons and glial cells. This leads to cortical expansion, increases neurogenesis and causes the characteristic folded cerebral cortex architecture in gyrencephalic species like humans. 2) due to their migratory capacity, RG form scaffolds for migrating neurons and hence represent the pillars of cortex formation. As a consequence of disturbance of RG function during human brain development, neurodevelopmental disorders such as heterotopia and lissencephaly can develop. Neurospheres are well-suited cell systems for studying neural cell migration since without any additional cues the cells start wandering out of the spheres once they are plated on a suitable matrix. In our human neurosphere test system, we established a RG migration test method (NPC2a assay) that specifically measures the migration distance travelled by RG cells. In our studies, plating of hNPC neurospheres on poly-D-lysine/laminin-coated matrices initiates cell migration in radial trajectories, forming a circular migration area around the sphere core."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

These data demonstrate that this microelectrode array-based assay for developing cortical network function is amenable to medium-throughput evaluation of environmental substances for DNT hazard and further prioritization. For comprehensive identification of compounds of concern, this assay will be a useful component of a battery of assays targeting independent neurodevelopmental processes. Key words: screening; microelectrode array; cell culture; in vitro and alternatives; neurotoxicity; developmental; neurotoxicology. There is concern that exposure to environmental chemicals may contribute to a number of neurodevelopmental disorders in children. However, evaluation of developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) hazard has progressed slowly in comparison to other adverse health outcomes. This is primarily due to a lack of reliable, rapid, and cost-efficient screening methods for neurodevelopmental endpoints, as well as the complexity of developmental processes that occur in a spatially and temporally coordinated manner. Current regulatory guidelines for DNT testing require costly studies involving hundreds of laboratory animals and a timeline of many months to years for each compound evaluated, severely limiting throughput of these studies. Recognizing the need for improved screening, several groups have developed various molecular, cellular, and alternative species-based assays focused upon key neurodevelopmental processes. By testing environmental compounds in a panel of more efficient in vitro assays, each technically validated for a particular neurodevelopmental process, an aggregate DNT hazard score could be assigned to prioritize compounds more rapidly for further investigation."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

In addition, the recently determined structure of the PP2A:B55-IER5 complex 28 showed that IER5 forms a helix-turn-helix bundle that engages B55 through a third conformation. These data suggest that regulators and substrates use diverse strategies to bind and recruit PP2A:B55. To define the mechanisms used by substrates and regulators to recruit PP2A:B55 and to understand how these interactions direct PP2A:B55 activity, we determined the cryo-EM structures of a B55-specific substrate, p107, and a regulator, Eya3, bound to PP2A:B55 and determined how these interactions direct substrate dephosphorylation. Our data show that both p107 and Eya3 bind to B55 using B55 interaction surfaces also used by FAM122A, ARPP19 and IER5 (that is, the B55 wall and B55 platform) (Fig. 6a). Thus, while two interaction surfaces of B55 engage multiple regulators (wall and platform), others (thus far) are used exclusively by ARPP19 (entry and hook); future work will be needed to determine whether these latter interaction surfaces are truly specific to ARPP19 or are used by other regulators and/or substrates. In addition, only the inhibitors FAM122A and ARPP19 stably bound the PP2Ac active site (Fig. 6b).

Anticholinesterase insecticides such as organophosphorous (OP) and carbamates pesticides (CB); and synthetic pyrethroids (SP) pesticides commonly co-occur in the environment. This raises the possibility of antagonistic, additive, or synergistic neurotoxicity in exposed organisms. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition has been demonstrated to be useful as a biomarker for exposure to OP and CBs in many environments.

Since then, computational methods especially the use of public databases and the invention of AOP-wiki have been used broadly in the integrating mechanisms of toxicants and exploiting the associations of stressors and events. Public databases have shown distinguished capability in obtaining scientific and reliable information. Calculation from public databases can reportedly accelerate the exploitation of AOP. As one of the most widely used and studied chemicals, BPA and bisphenol analogs have always been research-attractive topics, especially on the application of AOP. Several studies have verified the relations between bisphenol analogs and components of AOP on several toxicities, including hepatic toxicity, reproductive toxicity, carcinogenicity, etc. However, the cardiac toxicity of BPA remains unclear, leading to the objective of our article. Thus, based on information mining and bioinformatics analysis similar to a previous work, the present study aimed to establish the AOP for BPA cardiac toxicity following the OECD guidelines to provide information and clues for the progress of risk assessment. The workflow of the AOP construction is shown in Fig. 1. Target genes and part of target phenotypes were obtained by literature screening from Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) and by Venn analysis of the results extracted from databases.

Neonicotinoid insecticides exert neurotoxic overexcitation via activation of nicotinic ACh receptors. Traditional in vivo tests for the investigation of neurotoxicity of such insecticides and other chemicals are expensive, laborious, may not be sufficiently sensitive and often lack information on mechanisms of toxicity. Therefore, there is an increasing interest for the development of in vitro screening methods to test chemicals for (developmental) neurotoxicity. Voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) are likely a suitable target for in vitro neurotoxicity screening as-together with calcium permeable neurotransmitter receptors, intracellular calcium stores, and calcium-binding proteins-VGCCs tightly control the intracellular calcium concentration. This strict control of [Ca ] is essential for a range of cellular processes including proper neuronal function, development, and survival. PC12 cells are well characterized neuronotypical cells that are known to express L, N, and P/Q-type VGCCs. PC12 cells are therefore a suitable cell model for mechanistic neurophysiological and neurotoxicological (screening) studies related to these channels. The effects of acute in vitro exposure to pesticides on VGCCs in PC12 cells are already well-studied, and it is known that acute inhibition of VGCCs is a common mode of action of organochlorine, pyrethroid, and organophosphate insecticides and conazole fungicides. Moreover, several other types of chemicals have been demonstrated to acutely inhibit VGCCs, such as brominated and halogen-free flame retardants, polychlorinated biphenyls, and drugs of abuse."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

It was noted that the only the long and short-term effect of long-term CPF consumption inhibited AChE activity while high doses led to excessive endogenous cholinergic stimulation, causing typical cholinergic symptoms.

Over repeated pairings, this association can lead to the display of canonical defensive behaviors, such as freezing. Endogenous opioid signaling modulates the strength of this learning. For example, blockade of MORs with peripherallyadministered naloxone can promote acquisition of fear learning in rats and humans,while intra-vlPAG microinfusion of the selective MOR antagonist CTAP was found to prevent associative blocking of fear. This effect is likely not purely pain-driven as acquisition of fear to aversive, non-noxious unconditioned stimuli is also enhanced by MOR antagonist treatment. From these findings, it is hypothesized that endogenous opioid signaling in vlPAG increases in response to CS presentations as fear conditioning progresses in a manner that limits fear learning itself and possibly the experience of expected pain. However, real-time measurement of opioid peptide release during fear conditioning has not been done. Therefore, in a trace fear conditioning paradigm, we used δ Light to detect changes in enkephalin release across ten fear conditioning trials and subsequent extinction of fear learning. Our findings agree with those prior studies, as we found a CS-evoked increase in enkephalin release onto vlPAG MOR neurons that persisted through the trace period during acquisition of fear learning."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"foot shock\",\"KE\",\"Pre-shock rise in enkephalin release; rapid reduction begins during shock\""}]}

It is also increasingly being used to treat autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. However, the chronic use of CsA associates with high incidences of nephrotoxicity and the eventual development of chronic renal failure. For example, most CsA-treated cardiac-transplant patients present with some renal damage after transplantation while all patients on long-term treatment with CsA experience chronic nephrotoxicity. The chronic CsA nephrotoxicity is usually characterized by tubular atrophy, inflammatory cell influx, striped tubulointerstitialfibrosis, arteriolopathy, and increased intrarenal immunogenicity. CsA exerts its nephrotoxic activity by targeting renal tubular epithelial cells. Thus, Liu et al. showed that CsA promotes the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in these cells. EMT is thought to mediate the inflammation-inducedfibrosis and eventual failure of organs such as the kidney. Several other studies also found that CsA inhibits the DNA synthesis of tubular epithelial cells and induces their apoptosis. Indeed, all renal biopsy specimens from patients with CsA nephrotoxicity exhibit tubular cell apoptosis. A very recent study suggests that CsA can also damage renal tubular cells by indirect mechanisms, namely, by inducing the production of osteopontin, which promotes inflammation that injures the renal cells."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Cyclosporine A (CsA)\",\"AO\",\"Nephrotoxicity\"\n\"Cyclosporine A (CsA)\",\"AO\",\"Chronic renal failure\"\n\"Cyclosporine A (CsA)\",\"AO\",\"Renal damage after transplantation\"\n\"Cyclosporine A (CsA)\",\"KE\",\"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)\"\n\"Cyclosporine A (CsA)\",\"KE\",\"Tubular cell apoptosis\"\n\"Cyclosporine A (CsA)\",\"KE\",\"Oxidative stress\"\n\"Cyclosporine A (CsA)\",\"KE\",\"Inhibits DNA synthesis\"\n\"Cyclosporine A (CsA)\",\"KE\",\"Targets renal tubular epithelial cells\"\n\"Cyclosporine A (CsA)\",\"AO\",\"Chronic nephrotoxicity in long-term treatment\"\n\"Cyclosporine A (CsA)\",\"KE\",\"Osteopontin production linked to inflammation\""}]}

This framework offers a structured approach to organizing biological knowledge, making it especially useful for understanding the mechanisms through which chemicals cause harm. Following a comprehensive analysis of the literature, an AOP was elucidated for key events linking DNA adduct formation, caused by compounds such as platinum anticancer drugs, to tubular necrosis, resulting in kidney failure. Currently, cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin are the three most utilised Pt-based drugs used globally for the treatment of cancer. The hydrolysis of platinum anticancer agents post-cellular uptake yields electrophilic intermediates that covalently bind to nucleophilic sites on DNA to form adducts that represent the molecular initiating event. When DNA repair mechanisms become unbalanced, the nephrotoxic response following the formation of DNA adducts leads to DNA damage and mitochondrial dysfunction. These events promote the generation and release of reaction oxygen species (ROS) to induce oxidative stress, causing cell death and inflammation. Upon detachment from the basement membrane, these compromised cells are subsequently deposited in the tubular lumen."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Carboplatin\",\"KE\",\"Dose-dependent kidney toxicity and oxidative stress markers\"\n\"Cisplatin\",\"KE\",\"Aquation (chloride ligand replacement) producing reactive intermediates\""}]}

The hiNPCs have the ability to differentiate into neurons and astrocytes in secondary 3D and 3D cultures. For the generation of OLs, however, hiNPC differentiation time takes at least 8 weeks and is therefore not directly comparable to the primary neurospheres which produce OLs within 5 days of differentiation. Here we present data on hiNPC proliferation, migration and the differentiation potential. When relating hiNPC ( Figure 7A ) to hNPC neurospheres ( Figure 2A ), they display the same neurosphere morphology and cannot be distinguished from each other with the bare eye. Moreover, hiNPCs express the neural stem/progenitor markers nestin and SOX2 ( Figure 7D ). The percentage of Nestin/ SOX2 double-positive hiNPCs (70.8%) was in the same ballpark as that of hNPC (76.6%). Human iNPCs contained 10.6% cells not expressing any of the two markers, which is higher compared to the average of 1.9% of the three hNPC individuals ( Figure 2 ). The proliferative capacity of hiNPCs was confirmed by measuring the sphere size increase over 3 days (iNPC1a) as shown in Figure 7B. hiNPC neurospheres increased their size by 53.6% during the 3 days in a proliferation medium containing EGF and FGF basic (control), whereas hiNPCs cultivated in proliferation media without growth factors (w/o growth factors) did not increase in size."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

However, primary or acquired resistance eventually leads to therapeutic failure. Recently, Shou et al. showed that CsA significantly increased the anti-cancer effect of the EGFR-TKI gefitinib in EGFR-TKI-sensitive and -resistant NSCLC cells. CsA promoted gefitinib-induced apoptosis by inhibiting the STAT3 pathway. This was supported by the fact that siRNAs against STAT3 had the same effect as CsA: they enhanced gefitinib-induced apoptosis in lung cancer cells. Moreover, the NSCLC patients who had high levels of p-STAT3 responded much less well to EGFR-TKIs. Notably, STAT3 activation is known to be one of the pivotal mechanisms of EGFR-TKI resistance and several studies show that cyclophilins, which are inhibited by CsA, contribute to STAT3 activation. Thus, combining EGFR-TKIs with CsA or another STAT3 inhibitor is a promising approach to improving the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs in advanced NSCLC. While the role of the STAT pathway in CsA nephrotoxicity has not yet been reported, several studies show that the JAK/STAT pathway crosstalks closely with MAPK. Since MAPK plays a well documented role in CsA nephrotoxicity (see MAPK pathway section), the potential role of the JAK/STAT pathway in CsA nephrotoxicity should be an interesting topic for further study. When the LLC-PK1 and MDCK cell lines were treated with CsA, the PKA pathway was activated. This caused DNA fragmentation.

Prenatal exposure to MeHg causes severe neurological symptoms including intellectual disabilities and cerebral palsy in children. Investigations of brain autopsy samples confirmed that exposure to MeHg perturbed cell migration and disorganized neocortical layering, which was verified in animal models. Dysplasia and abnormal cortical cytoarchitecture have been attributed to a MeHgmediated genetic reprogramming of signaling pathways regulating neural development. Hence disrupting the cerebral cortical organization, disturbing migratory processes and causing heterotopia. One signaling pathway affected by MeHg exposure is the Notch receptor pathway, which controls cell fate decisions, proliferation, migration and neurite outgrowth during neural development. Moreover, MeHg disturbs the cytoskeletal organization involved in cell migration by disrupting the assembly and polymerization of microtubules. Exposure of differentiating hNPCs to MeHg resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction of RG migration at in vivo relevant concentrations ( Figure 3E adapted from Fritsche et al., Moors et al., Baumann et al. ). No cytotoxicity was observed in the tested concentration range, indicating a specific effect of MeHg on hNPC migration.

First, performance based on reference chemicals was evaluated; except for the best 2-assay antagonist model and the best 4 assay agonist model, all of the highest performing subset models have 100% sensitivity, specificity and BA for the in vitro reference chemicals (red diamonds in Fig. 2). BA was also assessed for the larger chemical set. Beyond two assays, statistical agreement using all measures with the full model increases with the number of assays in each subset model. There are agonist subset models with as few as 6 assays and there are antagonist subset models with as few as 5 assays that have BA>0.95. Variability around the agonist full model is greater than around the antagonist model so that the best 5 assay agonist models are not statistically different from the full model once its variability is accounted for. In antagonist mode, only subset models with 6 assays have BA within the CI for the full model. Continuous measures of subset model performance as compared to the full model were also considered. For agonist mode (Fig. 2A), the R demonstrated improvement with addition of more assay data with the exception of a dip going from 2 to 3 assays.

By contrast, several of the 11 unknowns that had an effect on network function are possible DNT hazards. For instance, the tuberculosis antibiotic isoniazid has been found to exhibit acute neurotoxicity and the organophosphorus flame retardant TDCIPP produced a point of departure in a battery of neurodevelopmental assays. Interestingly, all 3 fungicide unknowns impacted network formation in this assay, with spiroxamine among the most potent compounds tested, and flusilazole relatively less potent but more selective. Based only on the present data, one might prioritize these compounds higher than TCEP, cotinine and sorbitol for additional screening. Measuring 17 different aspects of activity and synchrony from each cortical network provided a more complete assessment of network function than possible through any one measure. However, certain network parameters were expected to be more sensitive to chemical effects than others. The random forest classification performed here suggested the most informative network parameters for distinguishing between chemically perturbed and normal network function across time are mean firing rate, normalized mutual information, interelectrode correlation, and burst rate. This result is consistent with the generally lower concentrations required for perturbing these parameters compared with other network metrics (Figure 3A; Supplementary Table 2)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"TDCIPP\",\"KE\",\"Altered network parameters during development\""}]}

The MFR was first calculated for both the baseline and treated cases for each electrode. The average per well MFR for the baseline and the treated condition were determined for every experiment. For each individual chemical, the MFR averages for each well was weighted by the corresponding total number of active electrodes using EXCEL's SUMPRODUCT function and then averaged across the sum of those electrodes. The resultant weighted mean firing rate (wMFR) averages for the baseline and treated cases were then compared to compute a percentage change in the treated case relative to the baseline case.

Different sources of information were considered such as PubMed, ToxCast, CompTox, and AOP-wiki, and integrated to develop individual AOP and AOP networks. We took advantage of existing tools, WebGestaltR and the recently hybrid method called AOP-helpFinder, an artificial intelligence (AI) method that automatically screens and analyses abstracts from published articles to decipher relevant links between chemical substances (ie, stressors) and AOPs. The presented strategy demonstrates the ability to identify links between BPF, KEs, and toxic effects using existing sparse information. The integrative approach revealed a plausible complex AOP induced by BPF, leading to thyroid cancer, as well as an AOP network related to various types of malignancies. Overall strategy. Linkage between BPF (see §2), biological events and toxic effects were investigated using a systems toxicology approach (Figure 1). This multistep approach is based on integration of existing knowledge from various sources of information. In the first step, specific data on BPF-protein associations were extracted from chemical biology databases. Second, these BPF-protein associations were expanded to protein complexes. By using a high confidence interactome, we were able to decipher protein complexes associated with BPF (§3). Then, protein-pathway information was integrated into these protein complexes to statistically order linkage between the BPF and biological pathways (§4)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"BPF\",\"AO\",\"Cancer\"\n\"BPF\",\"AO\",\"Thyroid cancer\""}]}

We have illustrated this aspect here by the study of BPS, which appears to be a putative obesogen, like BPA and other bisphenol compounds. Exposure to chemical substances that can produce multiple health effects, such as endocrine disruption or metabolic disruption, represents one of the most critical public health threats at present.

Direct measurements of proliferation by BrdU incorporation indicated a 78.1% decrease in BrdU incorporation in spheres growing in the absence (w/o growth factors) compared to the presence (solvent control) of growth factors ( Figure 2C ). The proliferative capacity of Lonza hNPCs was reported previously. The neurodevelopmental process of proliferation is guided by various signaling pathways including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. To elucidate if EGFR mediates this proliferative cell response in hNPC, we assessed hNPC proliferation in presence of the EGFR inhibitor quinazoline PD153035. PD153035 antagonized the EGF-induced hNPC proliferation, as assessed via BrdU incorporation and sphere size increase, without inducing cytotoxicity. This confirms that EGFR signaling regulates hNPC proliferation in vitro ( Figure 2C ). EGFR signaling generally regulates cell proliferation, growth, differentiation and cell survival. In the developing brain, the EGFR is increasingly expressed over time and is mainly found in proliferating and migratory brain regions. The EGFR is therefore indispensable for proper rodent brain development. Specifically, the proliferation of murine neural stem cells and nestin + progenitor cells was previously increased by EGFR signaling in vitro."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"PD153035\",\"KE\",\"antagonized EGF-induced proliferation\"\n\"EGF\",\"KE\",\"increased hNPC proliferation\""}]}

The first report of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in animal studies in 1971 showed histopathological features of tubular necrosis and blood accumulation of nitrogenous compounds (azotemia), mostly due to kidney failure. In vivo, cisplatin causes extensive disruption of the kidney tubular structure, ATN and aggregation of cell debris in addition to tubular apoptosis. Studies and case reports have shown the spectrum of carboplatin and oxaliplatin side effects to also include reversible acute renal failure with tubular necrosis. Cumulative doses of oxaliplatin during a chemotherapeutic treatment regimen was shown to cause direct damage to the kidney in correlation with ATN. Oxaliplatin was shown to induce a pattern of renal disorders akin to that of cisplatin in rat renal cortical slices. Renal biopsies of a patient following multiple bouts of oxaliplatin chemotherapy were also demonstrated to show severe tubular lesion necrosis, consistent with those reported on primary cultures of rabbit proximal tubular cells. An in vitro study revealed that TC50 as low as 51 µ M oxaliplatin and 175 µ M carboplatin could also induce cytotoxicity in proximal tubular cells.

Thus, CsA may activate two Janus-faced pathways: one induces ER stress and activates the oxidative stress pathway, thereby inducing CsA nepharotoxicity, and the other induces autophagy, which reduces CsA-induced ER stress and inhibits oxidative stress, thereby attenuating nephrotoxicity. However, since several studies show that autophagy can also enhance CsA nephrotoxicity, it seems that the role that autophagy plays in CsA nephrotoxicity may be much more complicated than was originally thought. Thus, at present, it remains unclear whether autophagy prevents or enhances CsA nephrotoxicity. Further mechanistic studies on autophagy in CsA nephrotoxicity are warranted. The proposed mechanisms by which autophagy participates in CsA nephrotoxicity are shown in Fig. 3. 5. Signaling pathways that participate in CsA nephrotoxicity While the molecular mechanisms that underlie CsA nephrotoxicity are still not fully understood, increasing lines of evidence suggest that various signaling pathways participate in this toxic process. For example, the p38, ERK, and JNK MAPK subfamilies have been shown to participate in CsA nephrotoxicity, CsA decreases NO expression and thereby reduces renal vascular tone, NFκ B is an important target molecule of CsA that contributes to CsA nephrotoxicity, and the pathway involving thefibrogenic cytokine TGFβ 1 promotes CsA-induced renalfibrosis. There is also evidence that other signaling pathways, including those that involve Ca 2+, Akt, Nrf-2, and protein kinase A (PKA), participate in CsA nephrotoxicity."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"CsA\",\"KE\",\"NF-κB target and contributor\""}]}

Such approaches also do not allow for the measurement of activity in functionally connected networks of neurons, a prerequisite for nervous system function. Neuronal networks grown on microelectrode arrays (MEAs) have been proposed as a suitable approach for neurotoxicity screening that is sensitive to different classes of compounds, reproducible across laboratories and provides high sensitivity (correct identification of known positive compounds) and specificity (correct identification/rejection of known negative compounds) for training sets containing 20-30 compounds. Recently, it has been demonstrated that mwMEAs can provide sufficient throughput for compound screening while retaining the other desirable qualities of single well MEAs. Thus, neuronal networks grown on mwMEAs provide a means to evaluate further the potential neurotoxicity of ToxCast compounds. However, previously tested training sets have been limited in the compound space that was examined, as well as in the number of compounds from a particular class of compounds that were represented. Furthermore, these previous studies have not used compounds for which there are other screening data available, nor did they attempt to place results into the context of adverse outcome or toxicity pathways."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Therefore, differences in data obtained within these assays are not necessarily evidential of a false detection. These differences may result from several differences in the assay setup, i.e., species differences and exposure schemes. The hNNF and rNNF assays are based on the same basic cell types, namely neurons and astrocytes, but derived from different species (hNNF: human iPSC-derived neurons and primary astroglia; rNNF: rat primary neocortical cells). It is widely accepted that the predictability of non-human-based assays for human health is limited by species differences. Also, primary neural progenitor cells (NPC) derived from rats (PND5) are more sensitive towards exposure to DNT compounds compared to time-matched primary human NPCs in vitro. These two systems differ not only in their sensitivity but also with regard to their molecular equipment notwithstanding similar cellular functions. Recently, the co-culture system applied in this study was used for comparing acute effects of neurotoxic compounds on network activity to rodent cultures (rNNF) and revealed a considerable delay in human iPSC-derived neuronal and glial co-culture compared to rat cortical cultures.

Environment endocrine disruptors (EEDs) are a class of exogenous chemicals that can interfere with the synthesis, secretion, transport, binding, reaction, and metabolism of hormones in organisms. Previous study has shown that prenatal or postnatal exposure to EEDs could increase the risk of ASD in children. Evidence from epidemiological and clinical studies has also indicated that the risk of ASD in children is positively correlated with exposure to EEDs, such as phthalate esters (PAEs) and bisphenol A (BPA), and that co-exposure to EEDs likely led to a synergistic or additive joint effect on the risk of ASD. Di-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate (DEHP) and BPA are two widespread plastics-derived EEDs. The levels of DEHP metabolites and BPA in human plasma or urine are positively correlated, suggesting DEHP and BPA co-exposure exists. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the joint toxic effects of combined exposure of these two compounds. The adverse outcome pathway (AOP) is a conceptual framework that integrates causal relationships at different levels of events in biological tissues to illustrate the association between molecular initiating events (MIEs) and adverse outcomes (AOs). An AOP starts with MIEs and links key events (KEs) and with key event relationships (KERs) and ultimately with AOs."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

In addition, the inhibition of VGCCs appeared not or slowly reversible. The observation of not or slowly reversible inhibition of VGCCs in subchronic exposure conditions suggests that a single subchronic (24 h) exposure could have prolonged consequences for VGCCs function. Prolonged effects of insecticides on neurotoxicological targets have been reported before in vitro, eg, a decrease in GABA receptor function by long-term (6 days) dieldrin exposure. Also, in vivo studies indicated that subacute and repeated exposure to chlorpyrifos could result in persistent effects on neurotoxicological endpoints, eg, neurobiochemistry and neurobehavior were permanently changed by chlorpyrifos in animals. We therefore hypothesized that the not or slowly reversible inhibition of VGCCs could affect the response upon subsequent repeated exposure, in particular for persistent and bioaccumulative chemicals like endosulfan. Our experiments demonstrate that repeated exposure indeed augmented the insecticide-induced inhibition of VGCC. However, our experiments with repeated exposure conditions also reveal that cypermethrin, chlorpyrifos-oxon, and endosulfan are basically equipotent in inhibiting VGCCs in a repeated exposure condition compared with acute exposure (Table 2). Inhibitory concentrations of insecticides that induced a 20% or 50% inhibition (IC and IC respectively) in acute and repeated exposure conditions were generally in the same order of magnitude."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"chlorpyrifos\",\"KE\",\"Augmented inhibition of VGCCs after repeated exposure compared with subchronic exposure\"\n\"chlorpyrifos-oxon\",\"KE\",\"Augmented inhibition of VGCCs after repeated exposure compared with subchronic exposure\"\n\"cypermethrin\",\"KE\",\"Augmented inhibition of VGCCs after repeated exposure compared with subchronic exposure\"\n\"chlorpyrifos\",\"KE\",\"Not or slowly reversible inhibition of VGCC-related responses\"\n\"endosulfan\",\"KE\",\"Not or slowly reversible inhibition of VGCC-related responses\"\n\"cypermethrin\",\"KE\",\"Not or slowly reversible inhibition of VGCC-related responses\""}]}

These subset models are evaluated against the full model using 1820 chemicals, as well as in vitro and in vivo reference chemicals from the literature.

Chemical Distribution. In this study, we assembled a carefully curated training data set comprising 1486 compounds, categorized into active and inactive groups. Notably, there is an imbalance in the training set, with 1257 compounds labeled as inactive and 229 as active, illustrated in Figure 3A. Additionally, we examined the physicochemical properties of these training compounds to explore their chemical characteristics. 54 Key properties analyzed, including molecular weight (MolWt) and log P, revealed interesting differences between active and inactive compounds. As illustrated in Figure 3B, active compounds generally have a lower molecular weight compared to inactive ones, with averages of 231.4 and 247.4, respectively. Similarly, their medians are 211.3 for active compounds and 215.2 for inactive ones, indicating that inactive compounds are heavier. Regarding hydrophobicity presented in Figure 3C, assessed via log P values, inactive compounds are slightly more hydrophobic, with a log P of 2.63 compared to 2.33 for active compounds. The median log P supports this, Table 2. Performance Comparison across Models and Initial Sets being 2.7 for inactive compounds and 2.3 for active ones. In summary, inactive (nontoxic) compounds tend to be both heavier and more hydrophobic compared to their active (toxic) compounds.

When cytotoxicity was measured and considered in terms of nominal concentration in the microplate well, the associations with in vivo adverse outcomes (from databases and the literature) were weak or nonexistent. Ideally, chemical concentrations in the well should be determined, although this it was not possible in the present study due to technical, logistical, and financial barriers further reinforced by the relatively small volumes in 96well microplates. This remains a major limitation of our study that warrants future attention. Nonetheless, when our in vitro concentration data were modeled using the IV-MBM EQP Ver. 2.1 model to yield predicted values within the cell culture media, the resulting comparisons between the in vitro and in vivo data were considerably strengthened. Other researchers studying rainbow trout cells have highlighted the importance of considering physicochemical properties and modeling approaches when comparing in vitro and in vivo data, which is reinforced by our present analysis.

A workflow of the strategy is shown in Figure 1. Data Input: Data Description and Preprocessing Development of the adverse outcome pathway dictionary. In order to explore associations between AOP-related terminologies (e.g., ' obesity ' ) and a term of interest (here a chemical), an AOP dictionary that includes AOP events, i.e., MIEs, KEs, and AOs, was generated. From the AOP-Wiki database, we downloaded the available.xmlfile that contains all AOP information. We extracted the AOP identifier (for example, ' 72 ' ), the key event name (i.e., ' obesity ' ), the key event identifier ( ' 1447 ' for obesity), and the key event type (that is, whether the term is a MIE/KE or AO; for example, adipogenesis is defined as an AO). The AOP dictionary contained twofiles: one containing the AO names and one with the MIE/KE names. MIEs and KEs were combined into one unique table. Development of the disease dictionary. Controlled disease vocabulary from the U.S. National Library of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH, https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/meshhome.html) was used, which represented 11,850 disease terms. Development of the bisphenol S dictionary. According to the data sources, BPS is identified by different terms for its name, synonyms, and Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) registry number. In order to capture, as fully as possible, the existing biological and toxicological information related to BPS, chemical terms were retrieved using the PubChem database (NIH) (Table S1).

To rank the indolizidine ( /C0 )-237D-related compounds by binding affinity towards a 6 b 2 nAChR for computational studies, we docked the compounds with AutoDock Vina. Docking energies ranged from /C0 7.3 to /C0 5.4 kcal mol at one of the binding sites for the a 6 b 2 receptor (Table S4 † ). We summarize the detailed interactions between the compounds and the binding site residues in Table S5. † While the major forces driving the interactions between the analogs and the receptor are hydrophobic, some compounds made hydrophilic contacts with the active site residues (Table S5, † Fig. 2). Next, we used MD simulations with each of the nine receptor -analog complexes to check the docking complex's stability during the simulation and verify the binding affinity results from the docking operations by comparing the docking energy to the binding energy from MD simulation. We extracted the a 6 b 2 nAChR backbone root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) from the simulation trajectories to check the convergence of the simulation. We also extracted the RMSD of the compounds in the binding pockets. Analysis of the RMSD of the compounds in the a 6 b 2 binding sites showed stable equilibration in the binding pocket for six out of the nine compounds (Fig. 3)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Furthermore, we also tested catecholamines on IL-6 and TNFα secretion because catecholamines are recognized for their potent regulatory effects on immune function, with recent studies implicating activation of adrenergic receptors (ADRs), including alpha-ADR (ADRA) and beta-ADR (ADRB), as a critical mechanism in the modulating of cytokine secretion. To evaluate the impact of catecholamine compounds, we treated hiMGs with three types of ADR agonists: dobutamine, epinephrine, and isoproterenol, using a concentration-dependent approach within our microglial inflammation system (Fig. 4c). As illustrated in Fig. 4d-e, both epinephrine and isoproterenol significantly elevated IL-6 and TNFα levels, with epinephrine appearing slightly more potent than isoproterenol. Interestingly, dobutamine, which primarily activates ADRB1, did not elicit a similar response, implying that activation of ADRB1 may not be associated with pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in our model since epinephrine can activate both ADRAs and ADRBs, and isoproterenol is a non-selective ADRBs agonist. 3.5.

Individual data points are included and indicate consistent trends across mice in each behavior study. Mice were randomly assigned into control or experimental groups to the best of the experimenter's abilities, with counterbalancing for age and sex as needed. Once experimental/control groups were formed to comprise the studies cohort of mice, the cohort underwent all behavioral testing concurrently and experimenters were blinded to initial condition for analysis. Representative images of histology were selected to display viral spread, fiber optic placements, and endogenous fluorescence. For all imaging and behavioral studies, virus injected animals with either little or no evidence of viral transduction and/or incorrect viral targeting were excluded from any final analyses. In cases of unidentifiable fiber optic cannula tracts, subjects were retained if viral payload was correctly delivered to vlPAG (n=1 across all fiber photometry experiments; Extended Data Fig. 17 ). All data are presented as mean ±the standard error of the mean (SEM) for each group, and all statistical analyses were performed using Prism 9 & 10 software (GraphPad). Statistical tests used throughout this paper include paired and unpaired t-tests, Pearson's correlations, and one and two-way ANOVAs. When post-hoc testing was appropriate, following a significant ANOVA test, the Bonferroni correction was applied to all data.
