The most apparent difference in binding of these 2 molecules is the translocation of the toggle switch W6.48(336), though it must be taken into account that the LSD-receptor structure is a crystal structure and the 25CN-NBOH-receptor structure is a cryoEM structure, with the former having characteristics of an inactive state imparted by the experimental method. The N -benzyl moiety of 25CN-NBOH dramatically displaces this switch in a large translocation, shifting and rotating the sidechain ~80 and 5 Å compared with the inactive state structures. Both LSD and 25CN-NBOH have amines anchored to D3.32(155) and S3.36(159), but although mutation reveals that D3.32(155) is essential to the binding of both (and indeed, nearly all ligands at the receptor), S3.36(159) is far more important for 25CN-NBOH than LSD. Mutation of this residue is detrimental for potency and efficacy of 25CN-NBOH in both b -arrestin2 and Gq recruitment, the latter being more affected. Although the potency of serotonin is also reduced by mutations of S3.36(159), the activity of LSD is not reduced (Fig. 8)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"LSD\",\"KE\",\"Activates G protein-mediated signaling and β-arrestin signaling; shows β-arrestin bias over time\""}]}

Therefore, these individual cell types may respond differently, and obscure the ability to detect an influential response that is not occurring in the majority of cells or in a dominant cell population. Under the protocol used here, it would not be possible to discriminate differential responses of the cell types, and small responses in a single cell type might not be large enough to reach the limits of detection/significance, which could influence the identified pathways. Similarly, the metabolomics analysis was based on media samples, not intracellular metabolites. It is possible that such an approach favored detection of metabolites more associated with cellular death or altered membrane integrity over those that might reflect other biochemical processes. The advantage of this approach is that it would lend itself to repeated metabolomic analyses over time from the same well/population of cells.

Thus, of these 13 unique chemicals, only 2 (folic acid and sorbitol/glucitol) had activity and might be considered as 'false positives.'

The criterion for a 'hit' defined here and in Frank et al. was the alteration of a single network parameter sufficiently to generate an EC value.

Use of an IATA approach with this dataset could also incorporate comparisons of the results from this assay to other in vitro assays. A comparison of the potency and tipping point values for the MEA-NFA to AC values from the ToxCast battery of assays indicates that this assay can provide 'value added,' possibly by identifying the nervous system as a sensitive target for some chemicals, or by identifying other chemicals that may be 'promiscuous' (active in a number of in vitro assays). Among the chemical classes where network formation was a more sensitive endpoint than other ToxCast assays were many known neurotoxic/neuroactive chemicals, including the pyrethroids, organochlorines, and heavy metals. Surprisingly, although they were not selective, the strobilurins and statins were also active in the NFA and generally more potent in this assay than many other ToxCast assays.

Therefore, nonselective chemicals were not excluded from this evaluation. Finally, as stated above, this is only one assay out of a potential battery of assays, and in terms of using this battery for environmental decision-making, the overall performance of the battery as a whole will be more important than that of any individual assay.

A previous epidemiological investigation revealed that TCS exposure was positively associated with urinary β 2-microglobulin expression which is a marker of early kidney injury. In a rat model study, Ena et al. investigated the toxic effect of subchronic TCS exposure on male rat kidneys and demonstrated that high-dose TCS exposure induced histological changes as evidenced by the reduced Bowman's space, tubular lumen occlusion, and tubular epithelial cell degeneration. Moreover, Huang et al. discovered that TCS treatment gave rise to renal lipid accumulation and disruption of fatty acid metabolism in mice,finally leading to renal impairment of male C57BL/6 mice. In addition, several studies have proposed the pro-oxidant effect of TCS, while oxidative stress could also lead to decreased renal function through in flammation, glomerularfiltration barrier damage, andfibrosis. In human HRGEC cells, TCS treatment brought about oxidative stress and apoptosis, and then mediated kidney damage. Through these studies, it is concluded that TCS exposure dominantly disrupts the glomerularfiltration barrier and causes impairment of renal function.

Although tryptamines and ergolines bear a resemblance to the structure of serotonin, the native ligand for the 5-HT receptor, it is less clear how phenylalkylamines bind to 5-HT receptors. Some insight into this question was gained by examination of the recent cryoEM structure of 25CN-NBOH and comparison to the docked structure of serotonin in the 5-HT receptor presented by Kim et al in Figure S6D. In that structure, N6.55(343) H bonds to the 5-hydroxy group of serotonin and the indole NH in serotonin H bonds to S5.46(242). The edge of serotonin ring A is buttressed against G5.42(238) in TM5.

Nichols j ournal homepage: www.pharmrev.aspetjournals.org Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) is a small molecule hormone and neurotransmitter essential for the regulation of nearly every biological process, including development, gastrointestinal function, cardiovascular function, mood, perception, and nociception. When the 5-HT system is dysregulated, several types of disorders can arise including depression, anxiety, and inflammatory related conditions. 5-HT is the natural ligand for 7 distinct families of 5-HT receptors (5-HT ) that encode for 14 different receptor subtypes in mammals. Of these, 6 families and 13 subtypes are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), whereas one receptor family, 5-HT, is a ligand-gated ion channel. 5-HT receptors are the most abundant excitatory serotonin receptor in the brain, playing a key role in the regulation of cortical function and cognition, and expressed in almost every tissue and cell type at some level throughout the body. They are the primary target for psychedelic drugs, which act as agonists at the receptors, and also a target of atypical antipsychotics, which are antagonists or inverse agonists at the receptors. In this review, we present a history of the 5-HT receptor, its structure, complex pharmacology, and role as a therapeutic target where functional selectivity is an important consideration.

For example, they each contain an aspartic acid in TM3, conserved across all aminergic GPCRs, that serves as an anchor point for ligands through salt bridge interactions (D3.32(155) in the 5-HT receptor). Mutation of this residue eliminates binding affinity for most agonists. Because of the high-sequence homology, binding affinities between the receptor subtypes have strong correlations and agonists interact with specific residues at equivalent positions in TM5 and TM6 in the binding site to bring about conformational changes. Structural comparisons later will explore the slight differences in binding sites between receptors. C. 5-HT receptor functional selectivity and effector coupling GPCRs in general are known to signal through multiple signal transduction pathways. The 5-HT receptor was one of thefirst GPCRs found to display functional selectivity, or the ability to differentially activate specific signaling pathways depending upon the ligand and system dynamics. One dimension of functional selectivity for ligands at 5HT receptors is that they can have different potency and effi-cacy values for activation of the canonical effector Gq-coupled signal transduction pathway compared with other noncanonical signaling pathways, or biased agonism. For example, release of arachidonic acid (AA) through Src-mediated phospholipase A2 (PLA ) pathway activation in heterologously expressing mammalian in vitro systems can occur. Subsequent research has identified several functionally selective processes dependent on the receptor ligand."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Here, 136 unique chemicals were evaluated for potential DNT hazard using a network formation assay (NFA) in cortical cells grown on microelectrode arrays. The effects of chemical exposure from 2 h postplating through 12 days in vitro (DIV) on network formation were evaluated at DIV 5, 7, 9, and 12, with cell viability assessed at DIV 12. Only 82 chemicals altered at least 1 network development parameter. Assay results were reproducible; 10 chemicals tested as biological replicates yielded qualitative results that were 100% concordant, with consistent potency values.

These data indicate that the levels at which changes in development of network ontogeny are observed in vitro are potentially relevant to doses that result in neurodevelopmental alterations. The present study demonstrates the feasibility of screening large numbers of chemicals in the MEA-based NFA. In addition, the study demonstrates that the assay has high concordance and responds differentially to a wide variety of chemical classes. As outlined by Crofton et al., this assay was first evaluated using assay positive control chemicals, and then with a larger 'training set', wherein literature citations support their designation as DNT reference chemicals. Here, the testing of 136 unique chemicals, where the ability to cause DNT in vivo is not well established, represents the application of this assay to screening. In addition, the overall data set of chemicals tested in this assay is now over 200, which makes it one of the larger chemical sets tested in any DNT in vitro assay.

Triclosan (TCS; 5chloro-2-[2,4-dichloro-phenoxy] phenol) is a broad-spectrum, lipophilic, antibacterial agent. As a polychlorinated bisphenol compound, TCS has a distinct aromatic odor, not only easily soluble in water, but also well soluble in organic solvents, such as methanol, ethanol, and dimethyl sulfoxide. TCS has been extensively used in a variety of consumer products, such as toothpastes, hand soaps, shampoos, cosmetics, and other consumer products, as well as in clinical settings (antiseptics, disinfectants) and medical devices. Currently, the detection rate of TCS in the environment is quite high and almost ubiquitous. TCS is a widespread environmental contaminant and has been determined in urine, blood, breast milk, amnioticfluid, and so on from the general population in different parts of the world. It is known that humans could be exposed to TCS through dermal contact and direct ingestion, whereas in the environment, TCS exposure occurs dominantly via the contaminated water, food, or animals (Fig. 1). Also, TCS has been detected to bioaccumulate in aquatic biota, such as algae,fish, and marine mammals. Increasing literature has indicated that as a widelyused phenolic chemical, TCS has not only the endocrine-disrupting feature, but also the carcinogenic characteristic."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"triclosan\",\"KE\",\"Endocrine-disrupting feature\"\n\"triclosan\",\"AO\",\"Carcinogenic characteristic\""}]}

Activation of 5-HT receptors by certain agonists has also been shown to mediate potent antiinflammatory effects in preclinical models of human disease, and they also may have efficacy in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Interestingly, the anti-inflammatory effects of certain 5-HT receptor agonists have been shown to be functionally selective. Serotonin itself is primarily proinflammatory at these receptors. For example, 5-HT receptor activation by serotonin is necessary for T-cell maturation, recruitment of eosinophils to sites of inflammation, and many other inflammatoryrelated processes. Certain members of the psychedelic class of agonists, however, prevent T-cell maturation, recruitment of eosinophils, and production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in several tissue types. Furthermore, the potency of the behavioral effects and canonical signaling induced by psychedelics do not correlate with anti-inflammatory effects. Although activation of 5-HT receptors with certain psychedelic agonists can have very potent anti-inflammatory actions, some antagonists can also have anti-inflammatory effects, presumably through blockade of the proinflammatory effects of serotonin. 5-HT receptors are also involved in reward processes, prompting studies of its role in substance use disorders and addiction. Activation of 5-HT receptors leads to increases in brain dopamine signaling, whereas activation of 5-HT receptors leads to inhibition. Regardless, activation of both receptor subtypes has been explored for substance use related disorders."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"serotonin\",\"KE\",\"Necessary for T-cell maturation\"\n\"serotonin\",\"KE\",\"Recruitment of eosinophils to sites of inflammation\"\n\"serotonin\",\"KE\",\"Proinflammatory actions via 5-HT2A receptors\"\n\"pimavanserin\",\"KE\",\"Decreases basal activation of Gαi1 but not Gαq/11 (postmortem human brain)\""}]}

Finally, because guideline DNT studies are 'triggered' by other evidence of neurotoxicity under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, and not at all required under the Toxic Substances Control Act, only a small fraction of chemicals used in the environment have been assessed for DNT. Because of the large number of compounds for which no DNT hazard data are available, there is international agreement that novel approaches to DNT assessment, including in vitro screening approaches will be required in order to address this backlog, as current approaches are no longer sufficient. The lack of data regarding the potential DNT hazard of thousands of compounds in commerce, coupled with the limitations DNT guideline studies discussed above has driven efforts to develop alternative assays for characterizing this hazard. Because development of the nervous system is complex, with multiple potential targets being expressed in different locations and at different times during development, a battery of in vitro assays has been proposed as a viable approach to assessing DNT hazard. This battery consists of phenotypic assays that evaluate key neurodevelopmental processes such as neural progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation, neuronal and glial migration and differentiation, neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis, and network formation.

Current knowledge of the long -term human toxicity of insecticides tends to focus on the physiological end -points of exposure, often making assumptions by association. Despite the varied, specific molecular targets of the different insecticide chemical classes, the overall intended effect of insecticides on the cells of the nervous system is the same: the initial overstimulation and excitation of neuronal cells, resulting in cell exhaustion, degeneration and death. The specific molecular targets or mechanisms of toxic action are well known throughout the many different classes of insecticide chemicals, as they have been elucidated from traditional toxicity testing on animals and through the development of new chemical compounds that are similar in structure and thus have the same targets as their parent compound.

Reports by Qiao et al. speculated that TCS might alter sex hormone levels by interfering with the lipid metabolism of ovarian cells,finally leading to reproductive dysfunction. In contrast, in in vitro studies, TCS stimulated ovarian cancer growth by regulating cell cycles and apoptosis-related genes through an ERdependent pathway. Furthermore, Huo et al. reported that TCS modulated the miR-218-1-3p/SLC35C1 axis to regulate the proliferation, migration, invasion and inflammatoryresponseof trophoblast cells in vitro, providing new insights into the prevention of spontaneous abortion. Collectively, TCS could interfere with reproductive health through oxidative stress, hormonal dysregulation, germ cell autophagy and apoptosis, steroidogenesis suppression, and mitochondrial dysfunction (Table 5), although the specific mechanisms of action of TCS in infertility are still not fully elucidated yet. For example, does TCS exposure affect spermatogenesis by the disturbing blood-testis barrier, or affect semen quality by inducing apoptosis or pyroptosis of spermatogonia and spermatocytes? These are all areas for further research and discussion in the future. The liver plays a crucial role in metabolism.

In this study the most notable, specific difference between the two insecticide exposures was that of the TCA cycle intermediates and pyruvate (Figure 4), where both chemical exposures resulted in substantial and opposite responses from control in these metabolites, indicating that energy synthesis was disrupted in both circumstances to different extents. Pyruvate had the opposite response to the TCA cycle intermediates with both permethrin and malathion exposure. Permethrin exposure showed decreased pyruvate abundance compared to increased TCA cycle intermediates, while malathion exposure showed an increased abundance of pyruvate compared to decreased TCA cycle intermediates. Further to the earlier suggestion of glutamate -mediated excitotoxicity in malathion -exposed cells, it may be possible that if glutamate was being converted into other amino acids as an attempted protective mechanism, this would reduce the glutamate available to power the TCA cycle (via the glutamate/ glutamine cycle), and so account for the significantly decreased abundance of TCA cycle intermediates in malathion -exposed cells at 24 hours (Figure 4)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"permethrin\",\"KE\",\"Decreased pyruvate\"\n\"malathion\",\"KE\",\"Substantial increase in most detectable amino acids after 6 h\"\n\"malathion\",\"KE\",\"Increased pyruvate\"\n\"permethrin\",\"KE\",\"Glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity (described conclusion)\"\n\"malathion\",\"KE\",\"Glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity (described conclusion)\"\n\"malathion\",\"KE\",\"Increased cholinergic signal transduction and excitotoxicity (described)\""}]}

For example, although the indole moieties of ergolines LSD and ergotamine are offset from one another in their binding poses in the OBP by ~2 Å (a 16 rotation about the interaction with D3.32(155)), their rigid tetracyclic scaffolds retain interactions with the EBP to determine b -arrestin bias over Gq engagement, reflected by their similarities in DRY, NPxxY, and partial PIF activation. G protein activation is associated with a larger movement of TM5 and TM6, with TM6 traveling a further distance perpendicular to TM5.

The same is true for an important TCA cycle enzyme, pyruvate carboxylase, also located specifically in astrocytes. It is therefore likely that the observed effect on the TCA cycle was due to utilization of the intermediate metabolites, as opposed to production. The switch from TCA cycle metabolism to predominantly glycolytic metabolism would drastically reduce available energy levels in the cell and have an impact on cell survival, which would account for the significant decrease in the number of viable cells after malathion exposure compared to no exposure at 24 hours (Figure 1A). This was also an observed difference in response to permethrin exposure, which had increased levels of TCA cycle intermediates compared to no exposure, and significantly more viable cells present than for malathion exposure at 24 hours. Interestingly, previous studies on permethrin exposure in rats showed the opposite results to this study and a decrease in TCA cycle intermediates (malate, citrate and 2 -oxoglutarate) following exposure to permethrin, yet they did not report on glycolytic intermediates, or pyruvate.

As traditional toxicity testing is carried out using animal models, mammalian cell culture models are becoming an increasingly attractive alternative to animal testing. Combining the use of mammalian cell culture models with screening -style molecular profiling technologies, such as metabolomics, can uncover previously unknown biochemical bases of toxicity. We have used a mass spectrometry -based untargeted metabolomics approach to characterize for the first time the changes in the metabolome of the B50 cell line, an immortalised rat neuronal cell line, following acute exposure to two known neurotoxic chemicals that are common environmental contaminants; the pyrethroid insecticide permethrin and the organophosphate insecticide malathion. B50cells were exposed to either the dosing vehicle (methanol) or an acute dose of either permethrin or malathion for 6 and 24 hours. Intracellular metabolites were profiled by gas chromatography -mass spectrometry. Using principal components analysis, we selected the key metabolites whose abundance was altered by chemical exposure.

For this purpose, we synthesized several derivatives of DM, by replacing the cyano group with an ethynyl group possessing various substituents at its terminal to improve the chemical stability. These changes also avoid a production of a harmful hydrolysate. We then evaluated the effects of these derivatives on Bdnf eIV-IX mRNA expression and the morphological changes in neurons.

In addition, the prevalence of TCS in aquatic environments has made animal models of this habitat the subject of extensive studies of TCS toxicity. In peacockfish, TCS had the highest concentration in the liver. In a zebrafish model, TCS exposure resulted in the accumulation of lipid droplets in the liver by interfering with hepatic lipid metabolism. Another study also revealed that the toxicity of TCS was closely associated with the induction of apoptosis in hepatocytes. Sun et al. unveiled that chronic exposure to TCS in zebrafish triggered fatty liver and hepatitis, which were related to the expression of miR-30b and its targeted gene fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO). Likewise, Bao et al. estimated the toxic effects of TCS on mosquitofish and revealed that exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of TCS could activate the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) protein expression in the liver of mosquitofish and cause oxidative stress to the exposed organisms. In an in vitro study, however, Sun et al. showed that TCS suppressed fatty acid synthesis and human HepG2 cell growth by downregulating fatty acid synthase through multifarious miRNAs.

Atypical antipsychotics have targeted blockade of 5-HT2A receptors as part of their therapeutic mechanism. More recently, 5-HT2A receptors have come to prominence for their role as the primary target for psychedelic drugs, which activate this receptor subtype to produce their characteristic behavioral effects. 5-HT2A receptor agonists like psilocybin, dimethyltryptamine, and lysergic acid diethylamide have each demonstrated long-lasting therapeutic efficacy in clinical trials for psychiatric disorders such as major depression and substance use disorders. There is a significant effort in both academia and industry to develop new agonists of 5-HT2A receptors with therapeutic efficacy. There are 3 primary scaffolds for agonists: tryptamines, ergolines, and phenylalkylamines, each engaging different subsets of amino acid residues in the receptor binding pocket. Differences can lead to differential responses between ligands for functionally selective outcomes. Here, we provide a historical perspective on 5-HT2A receptors, their key structural features and motifs involved in ligand-receptor interactions, and how these interactions can affect signaling pathways downstream of the receptor. Understanding how ligands interact with the 5-HT2A receptor will fundamentally inform future drug discovery to optimize therapeutics for a variety of disorders.

SOX2 was common to both CA and 5FU. Although LOC102724788/PRODH was common to CM and DA, otherwise, each compound had different profiles of upstream regulators. All of the identified upstream regulators have important roles in neurodevelopment, as indicated in Tables 5 and 6. This study demonstrates that a multi-omic approach can identify critical pathways involved in neurodevelopment in vivo at concentrations of compounds that induce changes in network formation in vitro. Exposure to different compound classes during in vitro network formation for 12days resulted in different patterns of effect on network parameters. Further, different classes of compounds evoked different -omic responses, with compounds from the same class (eg, CA and 5FU) evoking similar responses while compounds from different classes (eg, DM and HP) evoked differential responses. This result suggests that these compounds are disrupting neural network formation through alteration of different pathways, but potentially with class-specific AOPs.

This study provides proof of concept for future cultured cell metabolomics studies investigating the neurotoxic cellular response to environmental chemicals that may be adversely affecting human health. To elucidate further the finer details of the metabolic processes involved and the potential mechanisms behind the development of disease, this study design should be expanded with multiple doses and varying time points of exposure, which would give a greater understanding of the directional expression of the observed metabolite changes. With the expansion of this metabolomics knowledge of the cellular response to toxins, it may be possible to isolate specific responses to particular toxins, and the downstream effects that can result from chemical exposure, which have currently gone unnoticed and undefined."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"malathion\",\"KE\",\"Disturbances in TCA cycle\"\n\"permethrin\",\"KE\",\"Disturbances in TCA cycle\"\n\"malathion\",\"KE\",\"Anti-oxidative stress defences\"\n\"permethrin\",\"KE\",\"Anti-oxidative stress defences\"\n\"malathion\",\"KE\",\"Glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity (described conclusion)\"\n\"permethrin\",\"KE\",\"Glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity (described conclusion)\"\n\"malathion\",\"KE\",\"Glutamate excitotoxicity (suggested by data)\"\n\"permethrin\",\"KE\",\"Depolarization and neuronal excitotoxicity (described)\""}]}

However, the deleterious effects of TCS exposure on the liver in mammals in vivo have been explored rarely, especially underlying molecular mechanisms. Therefore, we could combine metabolomics and lipidomics to reveal the metabolic mechanism of TCS-induced hepatocyte toxicity in the future. In addition, the role of gut microbiota on TCS-induced liver injury is still unknown, which should also be the focus of our future research. Previous studies displayed that TCS exposure facilitated colonic inflammation and aggravated the severity of colitis and colon cancer, but detailed mechanisms by which TCS led to colonic inflammation and associated colon tumourigenesis are currently unknown. A latest cohort study detected the unconjugated OH-TCS metabolite in human feces of TCS-exposed subjects. Aromatic hydroxylation is the predominant oxidative metabolic process of TCS and is associated with its toxicological effects in host tissues.

In males, TCS may reduce testosterone levels by interacting with hormone receptors or by disrupting testicular steroid production. In addition, the bioaccumulation of TCS in reproductive organs may directly affect sperm synthesis and semen quality and have carcinogenic effects on reproductive organs. And in females, TCS exposure not only influences reproductive hormone levels, but also leads to the impairment of ovarian function and even has an impact on the next generation. Mounting evidence has indicated that the liver is a predominant organ of TCS metabolism and detoxification. Huang et al. employed GCECNI/MS to determine TCS levels in different human tissues and affirmed that the liver was the organ with the highest TCS concentration. Hepatotoxicity studies of TCS in different species have suggested that TCS exposure has harmful effects on the liver and may lead to the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), hepatitis, and even liver cancer. In mice, it was reported that TCS exposure triggered the disturbance of hepatic lipid metabolism and then promoted hepatic impairment. After 21 days of TCS exposure via lactation, the delivery of TCS contributed to the premature development of fatty liver in neonatal mice, which exhibited early onset liver endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and steatosis.

The study by Zhao et al. revealed that TCS exposure resulted in colitis in mice, mainly because specific gut microbial β -glucuronidase (GUS) homologs converted TCS to TCS-G. In zebrafish models, long-term exposure to high concentrations of TCS disordered the composition of the microbiota in the gastrointestinal tract and lessened its diversity. Furthermore, former studies proposed that the gut microbiome was necessary for the pro-inflammatory effect of TCS, and intestinal barrier dysfunction and intestinal microbiota disorder were associated with miR-21. Taken together, these investigations above suggest that the detrimental effect of TCS on gut health may be related to the gut microbiome (Fig. 3), providing new mechanistic insights into TCS exposure and related diseases.

These may serve as initial KEs, where exposure of the cortical cultures used here results in decreased proliferation of the glial cells and increased oxidative stress in neurons. Further, according to Harrill et al., both CA and 5FU increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation in neuroprogenitor cells, and this also has been reported in primary cultures of cortical neurons.

Metabolic changes from exposure of rats to different pesticides has been recorded by previous studies, although in some cases, such as permethrin exposure, the observed metabolic responses were not consistent. Liang et al. reported an increase in free amino acids in the serum of rats following long -term (60 days) exposure to permethrin. A separate study comparing the response from multiple classes of pesticide chemicals found that there was no substantial change in amino acids in rats treated with a high dose of permethrin for 2 hours. In this study, the response of amino acids to permethrin exposure was varied, with some increasing and others decreasing (Figure 4 and Table S1), indicating that there is some response to the pesticide exposure, but that it is not a one -way effect. The response of amino acids may be indicative of other energy metabolism processes (e.g. glycolysis or fatty acid β -oxidation) being the focus of toxic effects, and that altered usage or production of amino acids is an indirect effect. For example, this study observed that permethrin exposure had a predominantly increased fatty acid -based response in the metabolome.

Further, there is scientific recognition that, for a variety of reasons, animal-based toxicity studies often do not predict adverse outcomes in humans. As such, in the last 15 years, there have been significant efforts directed towards the development and implementation of in vitro approaches for hazard assessment. Assessment of developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) hazard has relied heavily on animal-based protocols that assess numerous morphological and behavioral endpoints in offspring exposed, typically perinatally, to chemicals. However, a number of shortcomings of in vivo DNT guideline studies have been identified, including the high cost of conducting the study (approximately $1M/chemical), the large number of animals used (approximately 1000/study), and the amount of time it takes to conduct a DNT guideline study (up to 2 years).

Theirfindings did not support PI hydrolysis as a critical mechanism of the stimulus effects of 5-HT receptor agonists; however, the author did note the possibility that PI hydrolysis above a threshold level might be one of several required signaling mechanisms involved in the discriminative effects. Later, Garcia et al used a genetically modified mouse model in which the Gq subunit gene was knocked out and found a decrease in DOI-induced HTR when compared with wild-type littermates. It is worth noting that DOI still produced a significant HTR in the KO mice, so the study further supports the notion that the Gq signaling pathway is not the sole mediator of 5HT receptor-dependent behavioral effects (of DOI, in this case)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"5-HT\",\"KE\",\"Induces phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis via 5-HT2 receptors\"\n\"DOI\",\"KE\",\"Reduced HTR when Gq is knocked out\""}]}

These data suggest that the level of BDNF expression induced by 2a is sufficient to cause the morphological changes. In this study, we synthesized a series of ethynyl analogues of DM, to confer less susceptibility to hydrolytic degradation than DM. We found that the presence of a ethynyl group at the a -position was sufficient to preserve the activity of type II pyrethroids to induce Bdnf eIV-IX mRNA expression and morphological changes in neurons. These changes indicate that not only the cyano but also the ethynyl group can stimulate neurons, although the efficiencies on the inductive level were different. Furthermore, the same mechanisms for inducing Bdnf eIV-IX mRNA expression operate whether the cyano or ethynyl group is present. Changing the substituent at the terminus of the ethynyl group affected the extent of the expression, suggesting that it is possible to control the inductive level of Bdnf eIV-IX mRNA in neurons by changing substituents. Thus, the conversion from a cyano to an ethynyl group in the DM moiety would increase the safety of the compound in the living body, leading to more promising candidates for an agent to treat neuronal disorders.

To make these comparisons, the score values for a given component (eg, PC1 scores in a PCA model) were tested for normality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. If found normal, then a 1-way ANOVA test, with Tukey's post hoc comparison, was conducted. This allowed the determination of significantly different means (95% confidence) of score values for different treatment classes. All statistical tests on score values were performed with Minitab 16 (Minitab, Inc., State College, Pennsylvania). Statistical significance was ascribed to score values with a p value <.05. Univariate statistical analysis of metabolomics. To determine the significance of metabolite changes resulting from the exposures, volcano plot analysis was conducted with Metabolanalyst coupling fold change ( 6 1.8) and t test ( p value /C20.05) analyses. Spectral features identified using this approach were putatively identified using commercially available mass-spectral databases. (Supplementary Figs. 1-4). Isolation of RNA and sequencing.

TCS is an emerging endocrine disruptor that could give rise to reproductive disorders in both men and women. 3.1.1. Effects of triclosan on male reproductive health In mature male Wistar rats, a decline in the number of actively moving sperm and a reduction in testicular weight were observed after treatment with TCS. Lan et al. assessed whether TCS exposure had adverse effects on sperm or reproductive organs in mammals,finding that TCS displayed a trend to accumulate in the epididymis of male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats and that rats treated with high doses (200 mg/kg) of TCS showed a significant decrease in daily sperm production (DSP), changes in sperm morphology, and an increase in the number of malformed sperm. Similarfindings were reported in recent epidemiological studies, which pointed out that TCS exposure might negatively influence the semen quality. Exposure to low-level TCS brought about adverse effects on male semen quality, with an increases in sperm LIN and WOB observed in the third quartile of TCS exposure, implying a potential non-linear effect on male reproduction."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"triclosan\",\"KE\",\"Decreased daily sperm production\"\n\"triclosan\",\"KE\",\"Reduced actively moving sperm\"\n\"triclosan\",\"KE\",\"Accumulation in epididymis\"\n\"triclosan\",\"KE\",\"Reduced testicular weight\"\n\"triclosan\",\"KE\",\"Increased malformed sperm\"\n\"triclosan\",\"KE\",\"Altered sperm morphology\"\n\"triclosan\",\"KE\",\"Altered semen quality (LIN, WOB)\""}]}

Potential mechanisms of triclosan-induced toxic effects 4.1. Triclosan and reproductive function disruption Epidemiological studies have suggested that TCS exposure may influence semen quality (sperm alignment, viability, morphology, CASA parameters) and damage sperm DNA. The biological mechanism by which TCS affects semen quality is currently uncertain. However, in vitro studies in zebrafish demonstrated that TCS affected the testicular development and perturbed spermatogenesis by depressing the hormone biosynthesis of male zebrafish, such as testosterone (T), estradiol (E2), and vitellogenin (Vtg). Arginine is the main component of sperm proteins and has an essential role in promoting sperm production and providing energy for sperm motility. Exposure to TCS gave rise to a significant decrease in arginine synthesis and expression of retinoic acids (cyp3a65 and ugt1a1), ultimately leading to a reduction in sperm count. Meanwhile, in female zebrafish, high concentrations of TCS were suspected to cause a significant decline in zebrafish spawning capacity and to downregulate Vtg levels in female zebrafish through estrogenic effects, thereby lowering mature oocyte and egg production."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"triclosan\",\"KE\",\"Perturbed testicular development and spermatogenesis\"\n\"triclosan\",\"AO\",\"Affected female reproductive development\"\n\"triclosan\",\"KE\",\"Sperm DNA damage\"\n\"triclosan\",\"KE\",\"Decreased daily sperm production\"\n\"triclosan\",\"KE\",\"Reduced testicular weight\"\n\"triclosan\",\"KE\",\"Altered semen quality (LIN, WOB)\""}]}

It is worth noting here that differences in cell phenotypes between heterologous expression systems (eg, cell lines engineered to express a specific receptor) and native systems (eg, primary cells or tissues) can significantly affect perceived signaling outcomes. Heterologous systems can lack the full complement of endogenous signaling pathways, scaffolding proteins, and regulatory mechanisms present in native systems, which can lead to altered responses. Because functional selectivity trends observed in heterologous expression systems may not fully reflect the signaling behavior of a native system, caution must be exercised when extrapolating results to make inferences regarding more complex native cellular environments. D. Ligand-receptor binding: general conformational themes The determination of structures at atomic resolution via x-ray crystallography and single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) has been a powerful tool for investigating specific ligandreceptor binding motifs and their consequences on signaling and making inferences regarding biased agonism. Recently, the resolution of the structure of the 5-HT receptor bound to several different ligands has led to unprecedented opportunities to analyze the binding dynamics of this receptor in complex with different classes of agonists, antagonists, and inverse agonists.

In a recent box of prospective studies, TCS exposure concentrations were divided into three tiers by determining urine samples from men, and the highest TCS exposure level was significantly associated with increased infertility, results demonstrating that the TCS exposure concentration was correlated positively with infertility, whereas negatively with fertility. Furthermore, TCS also had the potential to influence hormone receptor expressions directly and indirectly or restrain testicular steroidogenesis, thereby perturbing male reproduction and fertility. As expected, the deleterious effect of TCS on reproduction also frequently appeared in diverse animal models. A study on adult zebrafish revealed that TCS could disturb testicular development and spermatogenesis by interfering with sex hormone levels. Likewise, our previous work uncovered the abnormal alteration in testicular tissue morphology and the suppression of testosterone biosynthesis in Leydig cells after TCS exposure. In addition, it is shown that TCS exposure may exert carcinogenic effects on reproductive organs. TCS stimulated human prostate cancer stromal cells to secrete vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a factor that promotes tumor growth, and it could also advance prostate cancer metastasis through regulating epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers as well as related signaling pathways. From these studies, we have summarized the potential effects of TCS exposure on the male reproductive system (Table 1). 3.1.2.

Moreover, it was reported that TCS exposure triggered neurotoxicity. Diao et al. recently elucidated that TCS exerted neurodevelopmental toxicity by upregulating miR-144 expression and causing abnormal regulation of neurologically related genes. Also, neurobehavioral toxicity was observed in the offspring of mice treated subcutaneously with TCS. Zhang et al. investigated the potential effect of TCS exposure on the thyroid function in SD rats and noted that TCS decreased thyroid hormone levels including total thyroxine (TT4), free thyroxine (FT4), total triiodothyronine (TT3), and free triiodothyronine (FT3) by restraining thyroid peroxidase (TPO). In a zebrafish model, Tang et al. discovered that exposure to TCS postponed the hatching of zebrafish embryos and downregulated TT4 and FT3 levels in zebrafish larvae and FT4 levels in adult zebrafish. Meanwhile, a recent epidemiological study pointed out a significant inverse association between maternal urinary TCS and cord blood FT3 as well as maternal blood FT4 and TSH concentrations in late pregnancy.

The integration of differentially expressed genes and metabolites for each neurotoxicant was analyzed using ingenuity pathway analysis.

Metabolomics has been widely applied in the field of toxicology, mainly in the context of animal studies and the analysis of urine or plasma for the discovery of biomarkers of toxic chemical exposure. There are studies that have utilized mammalian cell culture metabolomics to look specifically at the metabolic effects of toxic chemical exposure, only a handful of these have specifically investigated neurotoxicity including exposure to thalidomide, methyl -mercury and caffeine. There is clearly great potential in the application of mammalian cell culture metabolomics in the study of insecticide toxicology, and metabolomics has been suggested to be an important technique in the development of new, safer pesticide chemicals. The B50 neuroblastoma cell line was derived from the rat neonatal central nervous system and is in wide use today in studies of central nervous system neurons in culture.

Here, we shall summarize the literature, cognizant of the considerations and limitations noted above. We will focus on specific aspects of canonical and noncanonical signaling; however, there are several additional effectors and second messengers whose activity is regulated downstream of 5-HT receptor activation. A summary graphic of some of these is shown in Fig. 9. 5-HT receptors have been canonically linked to the Gqcoupled signal transduction pathway; accordingly, most studies indicate coupling with pertussis-toxin insensitive Gq-like transducers. Receptor-mediated Gq activation leads to stimulation of PI-specific phospholipase C (PLC)b, which cleaves the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, resulting in the formation of diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP ). Both products of PI hydrolysis subsequently act as signaling molecules in second messenger pathways: diacylglycerol, remaining membranetethered, activates protein kinase C and IP diffuses through the cytosol and activates IP receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

In 1948, Maurice Rapport, Arda Green, and Irvine Page identified a substance from coagulated bovine blood that caused vasoconstriction and named it serotonin. Later, in 1952, the structures of enteramine and serotonin were determined to be identical. At that time serotonin was thought to participate only in peripheral processes such as gastrointestinal and cardiovascular function. However, in 1952, Betty Twarog surprisingly found that serotonin was present in mammalian brain tissue. Subsequently, chemical synthesis of 5-HT readily allowed for investigations into its physiological functions without having to purify it from blood or other tissues. Serotonin was initially found to exert its effects through receptors that were classified into 2 groups in 1957: tryptamine ' D ' receptors, which were thought to be found in smooth muscle and mediate contraction and were blocked by the chemical dibenzyline, and ' M ' receptors, which were thought to be on ganglia or nerves and caused depolarization of cholinergic nerves within muscle and were blocked by morphine. In 1979, after radioligand binding studies using several agonist and antagonist ligands, Peroutka and Snyder defined serotonin receptors as 5-HT and 5-HT based on their differential sensitivity to specific radioligands. The ' D ' receptors were found to be 5-HT receptors, and the ' M ' type corresponded to what are now known as 5-HT receptors."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

In summary, the present results demonstrate that screening and prioritization of potential DNT using the NFA is feasible, and that this assay provides excellent sensitivity, specificity and concordance. The results can be compared to outcomes from other ToxCast assays, incorporated in to IATAs and used to select chemicals for additional testing and hazard characterization. That other laboratories have demonstrated alterations in network activity following chronic or developmental exposures indicates that the approach can be adopted across laboratories, although standardization of approach is needed. As such, this assay can be a valuable addition to a battery of higher throughput approaches to characterizing chemicals for DNT hazard.

Beyond Gq-PLC-mediated PI hydrolysis, 5-HT receptors also have been linked to the activity of PLA. The link between 5-HTand PLA activity wasfirst reported by Gullis and Rowe in a subsequently retracted publication using guinea pig cortex, but the connection to 5-HT receptors was not made until Felder et al used mixed mouse hippocampal neuronal-glial cultures.

It is at the level of canonical pathways that even more divergence is observed between the compounds tested (Table 3).

This interaction is critical for monoaminereceptors,andindeed,mutationof this residue results in a loss of function for most 5-HT agonists (Fig. 4). a. Residues involved in signaling. There are different elements of ligand binding and receptor conformation that can indicate signaling through different pathways.

With the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of disinfectants has grown significantly around the world. Triclosan (TCS), namely 5-chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy) phenol or 2,4,4 ′ -trichloro-2 ′ -hydroxydiphenyl ether, is a broad-spectrum, lipophilic, antibacterial agent that is extensively used in multifarious consumer products. Due to the widespread use and bioaccumulation, TCS is frequently detected in the environment and human biological samples. Accumulating evidence suggests that TCS is considered as a novel endocrine disruptor and may have potential unfavorable effects on human health, but studies on the toxic effect mediated by TCS exposure as well as its underlying mechanisms of action are relatively sparse."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Indeed, many GPCRs bind a variety of molecules while sharing a common architecture conserved over the course of evolution. 5-HT receptors are the only serotonin receptors that primarily couple to G a -mediated (Gq) signal transduction, and are found across evolution from worms to insects to humans. Although some invertebrates have more than one gene encoding for Gq-linked serotonin receptors, such as in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster, these genes and the proteins they encode are generally related to mammalian 5-HT receptors in sequence and pharmacology as a whole rather than a particular subtype. Therefore, at some point in early vertebrate evolution, gene duplication and divergence likely occurred to give rise to the current 5-HT receptor family from a single proto-5-HT invertebrate receptor. Among mammals, there is a high degree of homology (~90%); however, there are some key differences between species. For example, a single amino acid difference, changing a serine to an alanine, at position 5.46(242) between mouse and human is largely responsible for dramatic pharmacological differences between the 2 species ' version of 5HT receptors. 5-HT receptors have been implicated in depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder, gastrointestinal disorders, cardiovascular disease, and several additional central nervous system and peripheral disorders."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

A greater understanding of this receptor and its actions will also aid in exploring several crucial functions in which it is involved, such as consciousness, perception, and learning and memory. Beyond the treatment of disorders, a detailed understanding of functional selectivity at the 5HT receptor could open doors for a more thorough model of cognition at large, given the essential role of serotonergic signaling in the central nervous system.

Alternative splicing results in several transcripts. The majority of expressed transcripts encode for the complete protein of 471 amino acids (in humans) and vary only in the 5 ʹ -untranslated region, whereas N-terminal truncations and proteins with less than 7 TM domains have either been verified or predicted. Several hundred different polymorphisms in the HTR2A locus have been identified through sequencing; however, the vast majority are rare. Only 3 or 4, dependingonthepopulation,haveaminorallelefrequencyashighas 5% e 10%, and only 2 of these are higher, at about 45% each. Of these 2 highest frequency alleles, one is a single nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter region (A-1438G; rs6311) that may affect mRNA expression levels and the other is a synonymous polymorphism that does not change the primary amino acid sequence (T102C; Rs6313). Several studies have examined linkage of these polymorphisms with certain diseases, physical or mental traits, or behaviors. Although the overall results of these studies are unclear, as differences between one population surveyed often differ from another, and many are unreplicated, there are some intriguingfindings. For example, rs6311 has been linked to parasympathetic activity, inflammatory disorders, and even success in speed dating.

Activation of a class A GPCR by its endogenous ligand is generally accompanied by a movement of helices 5 and 6 on the cytoplasmic side (Fig. 2), and the 5-HT subfamily is no exception. Canonical Gq signaling involves a considerable shift in these 2 helices, with agonists selecting and stabilizing this change, and antagonists preventing their movement. Although the ranges of motion vary, the movement themes are conserved across GPCRs. Outward TM6 movement expands a crevice on the intracellular side, which holds the G protein binding interface,flanked by TM3, TM5, and TM7, which form interactions with signaling effector molecules. Interaction with TM3 also seems to be important for ligand recognition in the binding pocket. Several conserved toggle switches and motifs that indicate the signaling state will be discussed in the receptor binding section. 1. Structural alignment with 5-HT and 5-HT 5-HT receptors bear high similarity in primary sequence to the other 2 members of the 5-HT subfamily, with all 3 members primarily coupling to Gq upon agonist activation. In radioligand displacement assays with cloned human receptors, serotonin has relatively high affinity across the family for the high affinity state as shown by displacement of agonist radioligands (5-HT: Ki ~ 10 nM/250 nM for displacement of agonist/antagonist; 5-HT: Ki ~8 nM/3 nM for displacement of agonist/antagonist; 5-HT: Ki ~ 8 nM/35 nM for displacement of agonist/antagonist)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

This could further uncover a living cell's metabolic state in the moments immediately preceding cell death, and comparison of this to intracellular metabolites of remaining viable cells may help to interpret where the ' points of no return ' might be for the metabolic state of a cell in response to toxins. Metabolomics has been proposed as a new and exciting technique to study the toxic effect of environmental chemicals and to test for their safety in mammalian cells. To investigate whether metabolomics can be used to elucidate the metabolic response of the mammalian nervous system to neurotoxic insecticide chemicals, we analysed the metabolome of cultured B50 neuroblastoma cells following exposure to the pyrethroid insecticide permethrin or the organophosphate insecticide malathion.

The accumulation of hepatic triacylglycerols (TG) might be associated with increased effectiveness of FFAs and upregulation of TG biosynthesis-related genes, including phosphatidic acid phosphate hydrolase (Lpin1) and diacylglycerol o-acyltransferases 1 and 2 (Dgat1 and Dgat2). In contrast, hepatic TG accumulation was usually considered benign to hepatic steatosis. Here, it was also noted that TCS was able to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPAR α ) without altering PPAR α levels, whereas it induced the mRNA expression of PPAR α -targeted genes, such as Cyp4a10 and Cpt1. As Cyp4a10 plays an important role in microsomal fatty acid (FA) β -oxidation, all these alterations gave rise to mitochondrial dysfunction and exacerbated liver impairment. Thefindings were supported by other study, which reported that TCS induced PPAR α targets, cytochrome P450 4A (CYP4a) and acyl-coenzyme A oxidase 1 (ACOX1), and then contributed to the increase in liver weight and hepatocyte peroxisome production.

The 2methoxy of the ligand, which is known to be critical for high activity, does not appear to engage any complementary polar residue in the binding pocket. Nevertheless, F6.52(340), which forms a pi-pi interaction with the indole ring of serotonin, also appears to interact with the unshared oxygen electrons of the 2-methoxy oxygen atom in an unprecedented lone pair-pi bond. Interestingly, the 2,5-dimethoxy substitution pattern of the most potent phenylalkylamine 5-HT ligands affords the aromatic ring electronic properties similar to that of serotonin. For example, calculation of the highest occupied molecular orbital for the aromatic ring of both a 2,5-dimethoxy-substituted aromatic ring and the indole ring of serotonin provides graphic similarity, with the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital for both systems nearly identical, as shown in Fig. 6. Antagonist ligands bind to 5-HT receptors and prevent agonists from binding to and activating the receptors.

It is now well recognized that humans are exposed to thousands of chemicals that have not been fully characterized for their toxicity, including developmental neurotoxicity. Because animal-based guideline studies are time-consuming, expensive, and utilize large number of animals, they cannot provide the data needed to evaluate the potential hazards of thousands of chemicals, including DNT hazard. To address this gap in knowledge, considerable effort has been made over the last decade to develop low-cost, higher throughput in vitro assays to test chemicals for the potential to cause DNT.

However, there is a relative lack of mechanism-based human studies in terms of number and scope, and most cohorts and in vitro studies have predominantly evaluated the toxic effects induced by TCS exposure, without in-depth dissection of the specific mechanisms of action and cellular targets of TCS. For example, recent studies have suggested that TCS could influence reproductive health and liver function by interfering with lipid metabolism, but these studies have not delved into the relevant microRNA gene expression that affects fatty acid synthesis and metabolism. In addition, a growing number of studies have indicated that TCS exposure disturbs intestinalflora homeostasis and has a carcinogenic potential, but there are limited studies on how TCS perturbs intestinal flora homeostasis, and there is a serious lack of cohort studies based on population data. Consequently, there is a great need for further work to focus on the underlying mechanisms of action of TCS exposure and characterize its toxic effects in animal and cell models. With the current explosion of COVID-19, it is foreseeable that antimicrobial agents will be used in large quantities, and the safety of TCS is worth further discussing and verifying.

One important future development would be the validation of the metabolic response in a human neuronal cell line, and the subsequent comparison to the rat B50 neuronal cell line. Previous studies have investigated the metabolomics response in rats following exposure to different classes of pesticide chemicals, which only compared the abundance of selected ' biomarker ' molecules from urine and serum metabolomes. The benefit of this cell culture metabolomics study in comparison to animal -based, ' biomarker ' measurements is not only in the direct analysis of the intracellular metabolome of the cell type of interest, but also in the untargeted profiling of all detectable features that allow for the comparison of not just relative abundance, but also the quantity of substantially affected metabolites from particular classes, or of a particular pathway, that are altered from exposure to different toxic chemicals.

This result indicates that ligand recognition by L7.35(362) in the EBP of TM7 may affect bias, which may result in divergent signaling effects. Tryptamine psychedelics most closely resemble the endogenous neurotransmitter serotonin. Although LSD and lisuride bind low in the binding pocket, 5-HT and psilocin likely have their indole cores located higher in the pocket. Because of the high homology between 5-HT and 5-HT receptors in the OBP, some insights may be gleaned from how serotonin binds to the 5-HT receptor from results observed with the 5-HT receptor. In the 5-HT receptor, the ring system of serotonin forms nonpolar edge-to-face contacts with conserved phenylalanines (F6.51(340), F6.52(341) ) in TM6, as well as F5.38(217) and V3.33(136). Accordingly, 5-HT is believed to make aromatic interactions with F6.51(339) and F6.52(340) in the 5-HT receptor, as well as hydrogen bonds with N6.55(343) and S5.46(242). Mutagenesis experiments have confirmed N6.55(343) to be essential for 5-HT agonist potency, but unimportant for the binding or efficacy of the ergoline LSD. Psilocin (4-hydroxyN,N -dimethyltryptamine) is a prototypical psychedelic tryptamine. Though similar to serotonin in structure, it likely adopts a different orientation in the OBP to differentially affect receptor function. Mutation of key residues in the OBP (S5.43(239) and S5.46(242)) and the EBP (W3.28(151) and L7.35(362)) reduce efficacy and affinity for 5-HT and psilocin."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"lisuride\",\"MIE\",\"5-HT2A receptor agonist\"\n\"dimethyltryptamine\",\"MIE\",\"5-HT2A receptor agonism (psychedelic target)\"\n\"psilocin\",\"MIE\",\"Active moiety of psilocybin (psychedelic agonist context)\""}]}

Furthermore, Wallach et al have recently reported on a series of b -arrestin2 biased 5-HT receptor ligands that did not elicit a HTR in mice. However, Rodriguiz et al present data that KO of b -arrestin2 attenuates the HTR in response to LSD. Further complicating the picture, Kaplan et al have reported the development of an agonist biased toward Gq with significantly reduced HTR. Note that Wallach et al primarily characterized substituted N-benzylated phenethylamines, whereas Kaplan et al characterized an imidazole compound.

Indeed, a decrease in BDNF-mediated trophic support has been detected in patients with depression 1 and Alzheimer's disease. 2 Since BDNF has low permeability through the bloodbrain barrier, 3 low-weight chemical compounds that induce its expression in the brain are potentially useful in the treatment of neuronal disorders. The BDNF gene ( Bdnf ) consists of eight 5 exons ( eI /C24 VIII ) and a common 3 exon ( eIX ), encoding a preproBDNF protein. Alternative splicing produces several types of transcripts between each of the 5 exons and eIX. 4 Transcripts containing eI or eIV ( eI-IX and eIV-IX mRNA) are expressed in an activity-dependent manner. Specifically, Bdnf eIV-IX mRNA is the most abundantly and widely expressed subtype in the rat brain. 6 Pyrethroids are highly active synthetic derivatives of natural pyrethrins which are toxins present in the flowers of Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Despite this, there were substantial fold changes in relative abundance in some of the ' unknown ' metabolite features (Figure S2), the scale of which was not seen in any of the putatively identified features both biological and artefactual, and so their potential as compounds of interest was noted. Owing to the large error margins with these higher fold -change features, it is difficult to interpret any such changes, but they help to demonstrate that this metabolomics perspective can detect both high and low relative abundances of a diverse range of different metabolite classes, as a single snap -shot of toxic exposure metabolic response of a cell system.

None of the compounds they tested, including tryptamines and ergolines, that had less than 70% maximal response of 5-HT (E ) produced robust HTRs. More recently, evidence has been published implicating the G bg subunits for mediating the head twitch behaviors induced by the 5-HT receptor agonist 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine through both ERK and cAMP signaling pathways. The key to designing functionally selective or biased ligands lies in knowing which conformational states of the receptor preferentially activate specific signaling pathways and how the system of interest influences the receptor interaction network, ie, stoichiometry and kinetics of transducers and effectors. Agonist-stabilized changes in GPCR trigger motifs around the binding pocket are the key to enriching active-state receptor populations with helical movements that rearrange microswitches. Conversely, the relocation of these conserved residues can also prime GPCRs for G protein binding and activation. A greater knowledge of the ligands that stabilize specific conformations for signal transduction of different pathways will allow targeted drug design for discovery and prioritization of different outcomes. For example, the functional selectivity of the N-benzyl phenethylamines reported by Wallach et al was dependent on steric effects within the space that the N-benzyl moiety occupied, and interactions of the ligand with W6.48(336) are critical for biasing this class of agonist toward b - arrestin2 recruitment over Gq."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine\",\"AO\",\"Induces head twitch behaviors\"\n\"2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine\",\"KE\",\"Head twitch behaviors mediated via Gβγ with ERK and cAMP signaling\"\n\"2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine\",\"MIE\",\"5-HT2A receptor agonism (behavioral effect context)\""}]}

However, the mechanisms by which TCS mediated negative health effects are still obscure. At present, the reviews on TCS predominantly discuss epidemiological studies and environmental effects. Therefore, this paper reviews the literature on TCS exposure in humans and animals and cells, and further summarizes the deleterious effects and potential mechanisms of action of TCS accumulation in various tissues.

However, it was erroneously thought to be a member of the 5-HT receptor family and named the 5-HT receptor. It was not until after the 5-HT and 5-HT receptors were cloned that the 5-HT receptor was reclassified and renamed the 5HT receptor based on sequence homology and effector signaling. 5HT receptors werefirst cloned from rat in 1990 by homology with the rat 5-HT (later named 5-HT ) receptor, the 2 being 49% homologous at the protein level overall, and 80% in the transmembrane (TM) domains (Fig. 1). Receptor selective radioligand tools allowed Hoyer et al to map 5-HT receptor expression in mammalian brain, where high cortical levels were found. Subsequent receptor subtype specific nucleotide sequence radiolabeled probes showed that mRNA transcripts within the brain for 5-HT receptors also showed high levels of expression in cortical tissues. The diversity of species expressing serotonin receptors suggests that they may havefirst appeared more than 800 million years ago, whereas GPCRs generally are believed to have evolved 1.2 billion years ago. Accordingly, serotonin plays a wide variety of roles in the body, with the highest concentration in mammals being found within the gut."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

However, because agonism of 5-HT receptors can lead to profound behavioral effects, activation of 5-HT receptors has long been a ' redflag ' in the drug discovery and development process, and the therapeutic role of agonists has until very recently remained largely unexplored. Another major factor in the lack of research into 5HT receptor agonists was the classification of several agonists of this class as Schedule I controlled substances by the US Drug Enforcement Administration in 1970. This classification presented major regulatory barriers to their access and study by researchers. Antagonism of 5-HT receptors is a common property of nearly all atypical antipsychotics, some antidepressants, and as pharmacotherapies for certain other neuropsychiatric diseases. Recently, a highly selective 5-HT receptor inverse agonist, pimavanserin, has been approved and used for the treatment of psychosis associated with Parkinson ' s disease. Interestingly, certain 5-HT receptor agonists such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin (once metabolized to its active moiety psilocin) have shown promise in clinical trials to treat a variety of psychiatric disorders including depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders. Results from clinical trials have demonstrated rapid and sustained antidepressant effects in individuals with either major depressive disorder or treatment-resistant depression. This efficacy may be due in part to 5HT -mediated increases in synaptic plasticity in key brain regions that affect cortical network activity. 5-HT receptors play an important role in learning and memory."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"psilocybin\",\"AO\",\"Rapid and sustained antidepressant effects\"\n\"pimavanserin\",\"AO\",\"Treatment of psychosis associated with Parkinson’s disease\"\n\"pimavanserin\",\"MIE\",\"5-HT2A receptor inverse agonist\"\n\"psilocybin\",\"AO\",\"Long-lasting therapeutic efficacy in clinical trials\"\n\"lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)\",\"MIE\",\"5-HT2A receptor agonism (psychedelic target)\"\n\"psilocin\",\"MIE\",\"Active moiety of psilocybin (psychedelic agonist context)\""}]}

Briefly, 17 different parameters describing spiking, bursting, and coordinated network activity were determined by analysis of each recording on each DIV. Trapezoidal area under the curve (AUC) measurements were used to collapse data across time and concentration and generate concentration-response curves for each parameter. Using the R programming language for statistical computing, concentration-response relationships were determined for each network parameter by a change in mean AUC (as percent of median untreated well AUC) over increasing concentration. Initially, data were examined for both increased and decreased responses. However, increased responses were observed in < 3% of possible outcomes. Therefore, the analysis focused only on decreased responses. All data and R scripts are available in the published dataset associated with this manuscript.

Although mescaline is the prototype example, it has relatively low affinity for 5-HT receptors. Conformationally restricted analogs of mescaline, however, have shown greater affinity at 5-HT receptors. When mescaline binds 5-HT receptors, the 4methoxy group likely adopts an out-of-plane orientation, allowing for hydrogen bonding with serine residues, yet maintaining an interaction with F6.52(340) that is essential for agonist activity. The amine-bearing side chain adopts a gauche confirmation, likely to promote hydrogen bonding of the 3 aromatic methoxy groups with the hydroxyl groups of S3.36(159), T3.37(160), and S5.43(239), which are thought to be important for agonist binding at 5-HT receptors. For phenethylamines that have a 2,5-dimethoxy substitution pattern, such as ( R )-DOI, the 5-methoxy substituent likely engages in hydrogen bonding with N6.55(343), which is implicated in ligand selectivity at the 5-HT receptor. N-(2-hydroxybenzyl)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-cyanophenylethylamine (25CN-NBOH), reported to be among the most potent and selective of the NBOHseries, is an ideal candidate for studying 5-HT receptor pharmacology. Its cryoEM structure in complex with the 5-HT receptor and an engineered G protein heterotrimer was recently solved in order to investigate agonist binding motifs. As mentioned previously, Gq is the canonical signaling transducerfor5-HT receptors, and its activation is linked to several known conformational changes.

Using NIH3T3 cells stably expressing the rat 5-HT receptor, Kurrasch-Orbaugh et al evaluated the effects of various transducer and effector protein inhibitors on PLA pathway activation, and through this work, the PLA pathway was shown to be much more complex than the PI hydrolysis pathway and involve multiple G proteins such as G (Gi), G, and G bg. Interestingly, Rabin et al did not show activation of the PLA pathway in PC12-5HT receptor cells, which further exemplifies the potential influence of system-dependent effects on signal transduction. Assessment of second messengers (eg, calcium, cAMP) is a robust method of measuring receptor function due to the amplified nature of the response and the commercial availability and technical ease of the assays. Indeed, many of these biomarkers were being probed before surface membrane receptors were widely accepted as separate physical entities. Two predominant G protein pathways modulate cAMP signaling: Gs through stimulation of adenylate cyclase to increase cAMP and Gi through inhibition of adenylate cyclase to decrease cAMP. There are published studies that have reported 5-HT receptor-mediated cAMP signaling, but the conclusions are somewhat inconsistent.

According to the work by Du et al., TCS exposure disordered energy metabolism by dominating glucoseflow to perturb steroid hormone biosynthesis and hormone homeostasis, and then affected female reproductive development. In adult female mice, TCS exposure downregulated thyroid hormone levels, led to hyperprolactinemia, and then restrain hypothalamic kisspeptin expression,finally giving rise to reproductive endocrine disturbance and functional defects. Furthermore, due to the increasing use of various daily products containing TCS, several epidemiological studies have pointed out a possible association between TCS and infertility and neonatal birth defects. Patti et al. assessed the relationship between TCS exposure during pregnancy and infant birth weight via the systematic evaluation and meta-analysis, and a significant negative association between TCS concentration and infant birth weight was observed in those with higher TCS exposure. Wang et al. investigated the potential effects of antenatal TCS exposure on fetal reproductive hormones in cord blood and the underlying mechanisms related to placental steroidogenic enzymes, confirming that antenatal TCS exposure was associated with the testosterone concentration in cord blood in a dose-dependent manner and male infants were more sensitive and vulnerable to TCS exposure. Likewise, a significant association between prenatal and early TCS exposure and allergic diseases was manifested in children. In the medaka model, TCS-exposed embryos developed malformations in the early life stage and TCS in this range might alter the sex ratio of developing embryos (Table 2)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"TCS\",\"KE\",\"Ovarian oxidative damage\"\n\"TCS\",\"KE\",\"Accelerated ovarian cell apoptosis\"\n\"TCS\",\"AO\",\"Affected female reproductive development\"\n\"TCS\",\"KE\",\"Hyperprolactinemia\"\n\"TCS\",\"AO\",\"Reproductive endocrine disturbance / functional defects\"\n\"TCS\",\"AO\",\"Lower infant birth weight\"\n\"TCS\",\"KE\",\"Altered fetal testosterone in cord blood\"\n\"TCS\",\"KE\",\"Downregulated thyroid hormone levels (female mice)\"\n\"TCS\",\"AO\",\"Allergic diseases in children\"\n\"TCS\",\"KE\",\"Suppressed hypothalamic kisspeptin expression\"\n\"TCS\",\"AO\",\"Embryo malformations (early life stage)\"\n\"TCS\",\"AO\",\"Altered sex ratio (developing embryos)\"\n\"TCS\",\"KE\",\"Downregulated thyroid hormones in zebrafish (TT4/FT3/FT4)\"\n\"TCS\",\"AO\",\"Increased infertility\"\n\"TCS\",\"KE\",\"Disordered energy metabolism affecting steroidogenesis/homeostasis\"\n\"TCS\",\"AO\",\"Allergic disease in preschool children associated with TCS\"\n\"TCS\",\"AO\",\"Delayed zebrafish embryo hatching\"\n\"TCS\",\"KE\",\"Adipogenesis in neonatal liver (lactational transmission)\""}]}

In otherfish, low-level TCS exposure also interfered with microbial nitrogen metabolism in thefish gut. Furthermore, in mouse models, short-term exposure to TCS at relatively low doses brought about low-grade colonic inflammation in normal C57BL/6 mice, whereas in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced C57BL/6 mice, TCStreatment exacerbated colitis in mice as well as colonic tumourigenesis and shortened the colonic length. At the cellular level, Wang et al. reported that TCS mediated autophagy in macrophages and non-phagocytic cells in vitro, killing E. faecalis, Lactobacillus and E. coli, disrupting the balance of the intestinalflora, and having a carcinogenic characteristic. In a previous epidemiological study, however, Adgent and Rogan examined the association between TCS and enterolactone, and the cross-sectional survey found that TCS exposure was not correlated with the production of enterolactone. Nevertheless, the use of enterolactone, an intestinal metabolite, as a marker of gutflora function is novel but crude, and only provides limited information about overall gut health. In summary, these studies have convincingly indicated that TCS exposure may exacerbate the development of colitis and colon tumors, alter the diversity of the intestinal microbiota, and lead to disorders of the intestinalflora. Therefore, the effects of TCS exposure on the human microbiota deserve further exploration.

By contrast, the higher specificity of the assay reflects a high rate of true negative responses, and a false positive rate of 16%. Whether this could be lowered without negatively impacting overall performance of the assay is a topic for future evaluations of the data. For example, by applying a more stringent treatment of the data such as correcting for the use of multiple endpoints, or by organizing the different endpoints into 'domains' that might reflect different aspects of network function, this might decrease false positive responses such as those observed with folic acid and sorbitol. Finally, the precision indicates that when a chemical tests positive, that in most cases, it truly is positive, and any future treatments of the data should endeavor not to negatively impact this measure. Several caveats should be kept in mind regarding the outcomes from the Confusion Matrix. First, the total number of known negative chemicals tested is small (13), and the balance between positive and negative chemicals is skewed (63 vs 13). In part, this is because it is difficult to identify truly negative chemicals. In this case, chemicals that are known not to result in DNT following exposure in mammals (including humans) are considered negatives. Identification and testing of additional negative chemicals may change the specificity and precision outcomes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Then we added various substituents at the terminal position of the ethynyl group, and biologically evaluated the effects of these derivatives on Bdnf eIV-IX mRNA expression. These ethynyl derivatives induced the Bdnf eIV-IX mRNA expression in a concentration-dependent manner, at varying levels but lower levels than that evoked by DM.

Moreover, our work suggested the need to further investigate the biological effects of TCS exposure at the metabolic level in vivo. Fig. 1. A schematic model demonstrated the potential exposure routes of triclosan (TCS). TCS could be exposed to humans not only through the dermal contact and direct ingestion, but also via the contaminated water, food, plants, or animals.

Second, the NFA is neither overly sensitive, nor insensitive. Many chemicals active in the NFA are also active in other ToxCast assays at similar concentrations, suggesting that those chemicals that are especially potent in this assay are truly altering biological processes important to network development. Further, for those chemicals not active in this assay, part B of Figure 4 illustrates that these same chemicals demonstrate a range of potencies in other ToxCast assays, suggesting that it is possible to obtain negative responses in the NFA assay for chemicals that demonstrate other in vitro bioactivities in the same concentration range. Based on the comparison of AEDs to in vivo minimum or LOAEL doses, changes in network development in vitro can provide a conservative estimate of the levels at which adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes might be expected, consistent with previously demonstrated outcomes for other ToxCast assays. Although this analysis indicates that concentrations at which changes in network development are observed in vitro are relevant to in vivo doses, there are important caveats to consider."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

Such a medication would by necessity need to rely on the concepts presented above, and lead to the creation and development of ligands that engage specific residues in the OBP to activate appropriate transducer pathways for therapeutic effect, while not activating those that elicit psychedelic effects. In the case of antiinflammatories, Flanagan et al demonstrated that the beneficial effects were independent of behavioral effects as well as Gq and b -arrestin signaling. These data suggest that it should be possible to develop a nonbehavioral agonist that activates antiinflammatory pathways. For psychiatric diseases such as depression and substance use disorders, where therapeutic effects and psychedelic effects may depend on the same pathways (eg, Gq and/ or b -arrestin), it may prove more difficult to develop functionally selective agonists with therapeutic efficacy in the absence of a psychedelic effect. For the moment one can only speculate and wait for future developments and clinical trials for answers. Understanding functional selectivity at 5-HT receptors is crucial for the targeted development of advanced therapeutics and will aid in the investigation of serotonergic receptors in general. A growing body of literature suggests the powerful impact that agonism and antagonism at this receptor can have in various health disorders where current pharmacological treatments are either lacking or failing."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

However, there is a serious lack of studies in this direction that have been conducted on humans or humanderived tissues. This also informs us of the greater need for future longitudinal epidemiological studies to examine the correlation between TCS exposure concentrations and liver disease. The hepatotoxicity of TCS exposure has been summarized in Table 3. Triclosan is frequently used as an antibacterial agent in a variety of consumer products such as toothpaste and soap. Surprisingly, one study reported that TCS-containing soaps failed to provide any additional skin disinfection benefits in comparison to TCS-free soaps. Several recent studies displayed that low-dose TCS exposure could not only aggravate colonic inflammation and exacerbate colitis-related colon tumorigenesis, but also interfere with the gut microbiota in mouse models, indicating that TCS might detrimentally affect gut health. Gaulke et al. exposed adult zebrafish to food containing TCS for four to seven days and then analyzed their microbial communities using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, data exhibiting that TCS exposure disturbed the composition and ecological dynamics of microbial communities in the gut of zebrafish and then facilitated the instability and reorganization of microbial communities."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"triclosan\",\"AO\",\"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)\"\n\"triclosan\",\"AO\",\"Colonic inflammation\"\n\"triclosan\",\"AO\",\"Colitis-related colon tumorigenesis\"\n\"triclosan\",\"KE\",\"Instability/reorganization of gut microbial communities\"\n\"triclosan\",\"KE\",\"Disturbed hepatic lipid metabolism\"\n\"triclosan\",\"AO\",\"Premature development of fatty liver (neonatal mice)\"\n\"triclosan\",\"KE\",\"Interfered with gut microbiota (mouse models)\"\n\"triclosan\",\"KE\",\"Low-grade colonic inflammation (normal mice)\"\n\"triclosan\",\"KE\",\"Disturbed gut microbial community composition/dynamics (zebrafish)\"\n\"triclosan\",\"AO\",\"NAFLD in neonatal mice (lactational transmission)\"\n\"triclosan\",\"KE\",\"Adipogenesis in neonatal liver (lactational transmission)\""}]}

That chemical disruption of nervous system development and neurodevelopmental diseases has commonalities at the disease and developmental disorder level is not unexpected, nor is it surprising that common cellular and molecular categories were impacted by these chemicals. It is noteworthy that the overall functional response of the networks was also consistent for all compounds, being generally decreased in both the limited analysis in this study, as well as the more complete analyses in previous studies. Thus, there is general agreement between the functional and -omic responses at the highest levels. When examining canonical pathways associated with the alterations in network function; however, some divergence begins to appear between the different classes of compounds. Axonal guidance signaling was associated only with the DNA synthesis inhibitors (CA and 5FU), whereas tRNA charging was common among 5 of the compounds. This could be a result of an integrated stress response.
