For example, CM and DM at the lower concentrations exhibited slight increases in IBI and interspike interval in network spikes (ISNetSP) and to a lesser extent, interspike interval (ISI), whereas HP depressed all parameters except for the percentage of spikes in network spikes (%SpNetSP). In contrast, DA, which was tested at a concentration close to its tipping point, showed small effects on the network function parameters, with the largest effect being an approximately 50% decrease in mutual information (MutInfo). These changes are consistent with effects previously demonstrated for these compounds on metrics of neural network formation following exposure for 12 DIV. Following the recordings on DIV 12, media samples were collected for metabolomic analysis, and RNA was collected from cell lysates for transcriptomic analysis.

The number of DEGs generally correlated with the magnitude of chemical effects on network function: 1572 and 304 genes were differentially expressed following treatment with DNA synthesis inhibitors CA and 5FU, respectively.

In the future, improvements to modeling of brain concentrations and in vitro to in vivo extrapolation techniques overall may improve confidence in AED values corresponding to NFA activity. In addition, metabolism of the chemicals tested in vitro is not measured even if it is likely to be minimal As such, it remains an uncertainty in this vitro to in vivo extrapolation. For the majority of the chemicals tested in the present experiments, their potential to cause DNT in vivo is not well established. As such, they could be considered 'unknowns.' Several different classes of chemicals were screened in the present study, and therefore rather than a chemical by chemical evaluation of the results, examination by chemical class may be more informative and efficient.

A similar theme was identified at the level of upstream regulators associated with compound exposure, with common regulators as well as unique regulators associated with each compound or among compounds with similar mechanisms. SOX2 was common to both of the DNA synthesis inhibitors, whereas LOC102724788/PRODH was common to CM and DA, otherwise the upstream regulators were unique for each compound. Overall, these results help us build putative AOPs based on the multi-omic responses to compound exposures studied here. At the highest level of organization, they converge upon a common physiological response (decreased activity in network formation patterns) and disease categories (eg, neurological disorders, organismal injury, and abnormalities). As one begins to explore further the canonical pathways contributing to these disease categories, some common pathways are found (eg, axonal guidance), but more importantly different pathways begin to emerge that can be associated with different compound classes and their modes of action. This hypothesis is further supported by the analysis of upstream regulators, which show some commonalities across chemicals, but more broadly identified unique patterns of response for each compound. These results suggest that the actions on network function are the result of not a single AOP contributing to the decrease in activity, but rather a network of AOPs converging to impact physiological function as measured by the MEA."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}

A group of 21 compounds were tested in the assay which were categorized as 'unknowns' with respect to evidence in the literature for their ability to cause DNT in mammals. The term unknown was used instead of 'negative' because the latter implies the compounds have been tested for DNT and found to have no effects. To our knowledge, this was not the case for the unknowns. These 21 compounds include a mixture of drugs (amoxicillin, captopril, fluconazole, and isoniazid), flame retardants (TDCIPP, TCEP, and TBBPA), fungicides (flusilazole, spiroxamine, and methylchloroisothiazolinone), herbicides (glyphosate and lactofen), and sweeteners (saccharin and sorbitol). It was found that 10 of the unknowns (1,2-propylene glycol, amoxicillin, chloramben, diethylene glycol, fluconazole, glyphosate, phenol, saccharin, sodium benzoate, and TBBPA) exhibited no effects on network activity over the concentration range tested in this assay (Figure 3B). Based only on the data from the network formation assay, these compounds would be of lower priority for additional screening.

The 2 assays provided similar results, with LDH release being slightly more sensitive, as it detected effects of 7 compounds where Alamar blue reduction did not reach the threshold for determining an EC value, and 5 compounds where LDH EC values were at least 3-fold lower than the Alamar blue values. Conversely, by the same measures, Alamar blue was more sensitive in only 2 cases (Bis 1 and thiouracil). Comparing cell viability EC values to the EC values for network effects allows for an examination of whether the effects observed on network function were specific or concomitant with cell death or loss of metabolic activity. This comparison was made for each network parameter and by using the minimum network parameter EC for each compound (Figure 4A). These results suggest that for all compounds that exhibited cytotoxicity, as defined by a 50% reduction in signal, there was at least 1 network effect observed at a lower concentration. However, applying a cutoff of 3-fold or greater EC for cell viability to EC for network parameter ratio (Figure 4A), some compounds caused network effects at markedly lower concentrations than that required for decreased viability, including domoic acid, haloperidol, and deltamethrin."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Domoic acid\",\"KE\",\"Selective network disruption at lower concentrations than viability effects\"\n\"Haloperidol\",\"KE\",\"Selective network disruption at lower concentrations than viability effects\"\n\"Deltamethrin\",\"KE\",\"Selective network disruption at lower concentrations than viability effects\""}]}

The higher the COV, the greater is the dispersion. Additionally, we included parameters that were previously described in the literature and represent a broad variety of network development characteristics. We then selected a final set of 14 network parameters that cover the three categories 'general activity', 'bursting activity', and 'connectivity' of neural networks and have a COV between 6 and 29 (Tab. 1). Concentration-dependent effects of pesticides on network activity After having set up the hNNF assay by defining a treatment scheme and standard operating procedure, establishing an endpoint-specific control, and evaluating variability over wells and plates, we next applied the hNNF assay to screen 28 chemicals. The set consists of 27 pesticides plus acetaminophen as a negative control compound. To identify concentration-dependent effects of substances that impaired neural network formation, cells were exposed weekly from DIV 7 to 35, including respective washout steps 24 h before each recording. As an example, deltamethrin and β-cyfluthrin reduced the mean firing rate (Fig. 5A) and AUNCC (Fig. 5B) of neural networks, respectively, in a time and concentration-dependent manner without inducing cytotoxicity. Acibenzolar-S-methyl, on the other hand, did not affect the number of active electrodes (Fig. 5C).

Permethrin exposure resulted in seven amino acid features that had an altered abundance considered substantially different from control levels, whereas malathion exposure resulted in 21 amino acid features whose abundance was substantially altered. The reverse trend was observed with fatty acids, where there were eight fatty acid metabolites that responded following permethrin exposure, and only two identified fatty acid metabolites that had a substantial fold change following malathion exposure. Overall, it can be observed that permethrin exposure resulted in a predominantly fatty acid -based response, whereas malathion exposure resulted in a predominantly amino acid based response. Perhaps the most marked difference in the direction of metabolite response between the two insecticide chemical exposures was in the TCA cycle group (Figure 4); inclusive of dicarboxylic acid intermediates as well as pyruvate, all of which are important in energy synthesis for the cell. In particular, succinate and malate showed a significantly increased fold change after both 6 and 24 hour exposure to permethrin, while the opposite response occurred following malathion exposure with a significant decrease from control of the same two metabolites after the 24 hour exposure.

Neonicotinoid insecticides exert neurotoxic overexcitation via activation of nicotinic ACh receptors. Traditional in vivo tests for the investigation of neurotoxicity of such insecticides and other chemicals are expensive, laborious, may not be sufficiently sensitive and often lack information on mechanisms of toxicity. Therefore, there is an increasing interest for the development of in vitro screening methods to test chemicals for (developmental) neurotoxicity. Voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) are likely a suitable target for in vitro neurotoxicity screening as-together with calcium permeable neurotransmitter receptors, intracellular calcium stores, and calcium-binding proteins-VGCCs tightly control the intracellular calcium concentration. This strict control of [Ca ] is essential for a range of cellular processes including proper neuronal function, development, and survival. PC12 cells are well characterized neuronotypical cells that are known to express L, N, and P/Q-type VGCCs. PC12 cells are therefore a suitable cell model for mechanistic neurophysiological and neurotoxicological (screening) studies related to these channels. The effects of acute in vitro exposure to pesticides on VGCCs in PC12 cells are already well-studied, and it is known that acute inhibition of VGCCs is a common mode of action of organochlorine, pyrethroid, and organophosphate insecticides and conazole fungicides. Moreover, several other types of chemicals have been demonstrated to acutely inhibit VGCCs, such as brominated and halogen-free flame retardants, polychlorinated biphenyls, and drugs of abuse."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}
