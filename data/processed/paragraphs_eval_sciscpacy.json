    "text": " Proper brain development is based on the orchestration of key neurodevelopmental processes (KNDP), including the formation and function of neural networks. If at least one KNDP is affected by a chemical, an adverse outcome is expected. To enable a higher testing throughput than the guideline animal experiments, a developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) in vitro testing battery (DNT IVB) comprising a variety of assays that model several KNDPs was set up. Gap analysis revealed the need for a human-based assay to assess neural network formation and function (NNF). Therefore, we established the human NNF (hNNF) assay. A co-culture comprised of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived excitatory and inhibitory neurons as well as primary human astroglia was differentiated for 35 days on microelectrode arrays (MEA), and spontaneous electrical activity, together with cytotoxicity, was assessed on a weekly basis after washout of the compounds 24 h prior to measurements. In addition to the characterization of the test system, the assay was challenged with 28 compounds, mainly pesticides, identifying their DNT potential by evaluation of specific spike-, burst-, and network parameters. This approach confirmed the suitability of the assay for screening environmental chemicals. Comparison of benchmark concentrations (BMC) with an NNF in vitro assay (rNNF) based on primary rat cortical cells revealed differences in sensitivity. Together with the successful implementation of hNNF data into a postulated stressor-specific adverse outcome pathway (AOP) network associated with a plausible molecular initiating event for deltamethrin, this study suggests the hNNF assay as a useful complement to the DNT IVB."

    "text": "The developing central nervous system is known to be more sensitive to exposure to toxic agents than the adult equivalent . There is evidence that environmental chemicals contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders in children such as autism spectrum disorder, mental retardation, and cerebral palsy. Pesticides  belong  to  one  compound  class  that  is  demonstrably associated with causing developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) . Today, only 35 of the 485 pesticides currently approved in the EU have been tested in DNT studies  . The reason for this lack of testing, which generally applies to all chemicals, lies in the current DNT in vivo testing guidelines, i.e., the OECD 426  and EPA 870.6300  guidelines. Their high resource intensity regarding time, money, and animals is a reason for the limited throughput  of  these  studies  .  Furthermore,  high variability and low reproducibility of in vivo experiments, as well as species differences, increase the uncertainty of in vivo guideline studies for DNT testing . In the last years, scientists from academia, industry, and regulatory authorities across the world agreed on the need for a standardized in vitro testing strategy, aiming for cheaper and faster generation of additional data for DNT hazard assessment . Following this consensus, a DNT in vitro battery (IVB) was compiled, which includes various DNT test methods covering  different  neurodevelopmental  processes,  so-called  key events (KEs), and developmental stages to approximate the complexity of human brain development . Within this DNT IVB, neurodevelopment is described by in vitro assays covering the following KEs:  human  neural  progenitor  cell  (hNPC)  proliferation    and  apoptosis , cell migration , hNPC-neuronal  and oligodendrocyte differentiation , neurite outgrowth  as well as neuronal maturation and synaptogenesis ."

    "text": "Another  crucial  key  neurodevelopmental  process  represented within the DNT IVB is the formation and function of neural networks, since nervous system development requires functional networks consisting of different types of neurons and glial cells . Furthermore, certain brain disorders, like autism spectrum disorder, Alzheimer's  and  Parkinson's  disease,  are  associated  with  dysfunctional neural synchronization . Important tools to study electrophysiology of such neural networks are microelectrode  arrays  (MEA),  which  record  extracellular  local field potentials on multiple electrodes at different locations of the network and provide information on electrical activity, firing patterns, and synchronicity of the neural networks . So far, DNT in vitro testing for synaptogenesis and neuronal activity is mainly performed in assays based on rat primary cortical cells . The use of a human cell model to assess this endpoint has been identified as a gap in the current DNT IVB because the potential for species-specific features is still unknown . The  introduction  of  human  induced  pluripotent  stem  cells (hiPSC)    has  extensively  advanced  the field  of  biomedical  sciences  including  testing  for  DNT.  It  has been shown that hiPSC-derived neural networks growing directly on MEAs exhibit spontaneous neuronal activity with organized spiking and bursting patterns , which can be modulated with known neurotoxicants and drugs . The neural induction of hiPSCs towards functional neuronal cultures comes with many advantages, especially with regard to disease modelling, but bears the issue of high variability between batches and cell lines. This variability is mostly due to the fact that every neural network differentiates into a variable number of neuronal subtypes. In addition, the generation of sufficiently active networks takes weeks to months . The use of commercially available hiPSC-derived  neurons  with  quality-  and  cell  ratio-controlled, reproducible cells provided in large quantities circumvents these problems . In this study we present the establishment of a human neural network formation (hNNF) assay based on a commercially available kit, which consists of hiPSC-derived excitatory and inhibitory  neurons  and  primary  astroglia  (SynFire,  NeuCyte,  USA). Pharmacological modulation confirmed the functionality of both neuronal subtypes, and chronic treatment over 35 days revealed the ability of the cell model to detect alterations by bisindolylmaleimide I (Bis-I) via a known mode of action (MoA). The assay was challenged with a test set of 28 substances and displayed compound-specific effects on network development."

Timed pregnant Long-Evans rat dams (Charles River, Raleigh, NC, USA) were obtained and housed in the animal colony in individual plastic cages. They were provided food and water ad libitum , and maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle at 37 8 C. Primary cortical cell cultures were made from postnatal day 0-1 pups as has been previously described . Pups were euthanized by decapitation and their brains immediately dissected and placed in ice-cold dissection buffer (phosphate buffered saline (PBS), 15 mM HEPES, pH 7.4). In a sterile hood, the dissected cortices were minced with fine scissors in a dish of HEPES buffer."

    "text": " Five pyrethroids (fenvalerate, deltamethrin, cypermethrin, permethrin, cyfluthrin) differing in their chemical purity were investigated on their cytotoxic effects, especially on their ability to induce mitotic cell division disturbances using Chinese hamster lung cells of line V79. The colony forming ability (CFA) resulted in distinct differences of the cytotoxic effect of the tested pyrethroids, whereby permethrin was found to be most toxic. With the exception of fenvalerate all tested pyrethroids gave rise to inhibition of cell cycle progression as shown by G2 : M-arrest of synchronized V79 cells by flow cytometry as well as by the increase of the mitotic index as evaluated by light microscopy. The mitotic arresting activity could be attributed to the occurrence of abnormal mitotic figures such as initial and full C-metaphases. The results however indicate, that pyrethroids per se do not contribute to the cytotoxic effects but that other factors such as chemical impurities, source as well as manufacturing process and isomer composition may be responsible for the observed cytotoxic effects. © 1999 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

    "text": "Control  of  mosquito  vectors  relying  on applications with chemical insecticides is an  important  strategy  in  preventing transmission  of  vector-borne  diseases, including malaria. Pyrethroid insecticides are currently used worldwide in agriculture and for vector control, however long-term extensive use of insecticides has been a major cause of development of insecticide resistance  among mosquito populations .  Con- sequently, resistance can lead to reduced efficacy  of  vector  control  programme. Pyrethroid resistance in mosquito vectors of malaria  has  been  reported  in  several countries  in  Africa  and  Southeast  Asia, including Thailand. Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) comprise a superfamily of enzymes that catalyze metabolisms of endogenous and  xenobiotic  compounds,  including insecticides . Examinations  of  various  insects  have  suggested involvement  of  P450s  in  resistance  to different insecticides, by virtue of enhanced expression of P450s and thus increased detoxification of insecticides. . Overexpression of P450s has been observed in several pyrethroid resistant insects  such  as  increased  expression  of CYP6D1 has  been  found  in  pyrethroid resistant Musca domestica , CYP6P3 and CYP6M2 in  multiple pyrethroid resistant Anopheles  gambiae . Anopheles minimus is  one  of  malaria vectors in Southeast Asia, including Thailand, Loas, Cambodia, and Vietnam. We previously determined that P450 enzymes might act as a primary route of deltamethrin detoxification  during  laboratory  selection  for deltamethrin resistance in An.  minimus . In parallel during selection, increased mRNA expression of CYP6P7 and CYP6AA3 was observed  .  Thus  CYP6P7 and CYP6AA3 could be implicated to play a role in  detoxification  of  deltamethrin  in  this mosquito. Pyrethroids are known to commonly target  on  sodium  channels  of  nervous system. Other toxic effects of pyrethroids toward cells include causing DNA damage, inhibition of mitochondrial complex I, and induction  of  reactive  oxygen  species (ROS) accumulation .  Cytotoxic  effects  of organophosphate and carbamate insecticides  have  also  been  reported  such  as oxidative stress, alteration of mitochondria function .  Thus treatment of cells with cytotoxic insecticides in  cytotoxicity  assays  can  cause  cell mortality  unless  cells  possess  ability  to detoxify insecticides. This is supported by that Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells expressing  CYP6AA3 have significantly higher cell viability  upon  treatment with deltamethrin than cells without CYP6AA3 expression  in  MTT  cytotoxicity  assay, suggesting that CYP6AA3 could detoxify deltamethrin in Sf9 cells ."
