Successful validation of genomic biomarkers for human immunotoxicity in Jurkat T cells in vitro Peter C. J. Schmeitsa,b, Jia Shaoa,b, Danique A. van der Kriekena, Oscar L. Volgera, Henk van Loverenb,c, Ad. A. C. M. Peijnenburga* and Peter J. M. Hendriksena ABSTRACT: Previously, we identiﬁed 25 classiﬁer genes that were able to assess immunotoxicity using human Jurkat T cells. The present study aimed to validate these classiﬁers. For that purpose, Jurkat cells were exposed for 6 h to subcytotoxic doses of nine immunotoxicants, ﬁve non-immunotoxicants and four compounds for which human immunotoxicity has not yet been fully established. RNA was isolated and subjected to Fluidigm quantitative real time (qRT)–PCR analysis. The sensitivity, spec- iﬁcity and accuracy of the screening assay as based on the nine immunotoxicants and ﬁve non-immunotoxicants used in this study were 100%, 80% and 93%, respectively, which is better than the performance in our previous study. Only one com- pound was classiﬁed as false positive (benzo-e-pyrene). Of the four potential (non-)immunotoxicants, chlorantraniliprole and Hidrasec were classiﬁed immunotoxic and Sunset yellow and imidacloprid as non-immunotoxic. ToxPi analysis of the PCR data provided insight in the molecular pathways that were affected by the compounds. The immunotoxicants 2,3- dichloro-propanol and cypermethrin, although structurally different, affected protein metabolism and cholesterol biosynthe- sis and transport. In addition, four compounds, i.e. chlorpyrifos, aldicarb, benzo-e-pyrene and anti-CD3, affected genes in cholesterol metabolism and transport, protein metabolism and transcription regulation. qRT–PCR on eight additional genes coding for similar processes as deﬁned in ToxPi analyzes, supported these results. In conclusion, the 25 immunotoxic classi- ﬁers performed very well in a screening with new non-immunotoxic and immunotoxic compounds. Therefore, the Jurkat screening assay has great promise to be applied within a tiered approach for animal free testing of human immunotoxicity. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Keywords: immunotoxicity; Fluidigm; biomarker; classiﬁer; genomic; qRT-PCR; ToxPi; prediction; Jurkat; high throughput Introduction Direct immunotoxicity is deﬁned as the action of a compound on components of the immune system that lead to either immunostimulation or immunosuppression. The assessment of direct immunotoxicity is an important part of the overall toxico- logical investigation of chemicals (Lankveld et al., 2010). Several authorities including the European Medicines Agency (EMEA, 2006) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA, 2002) em- phasize the need to evaluate immunotoxic effects during the preclinical phase of drug development. Other authorities such as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Develop- ment (OECD) (Institoris et al., 1998) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA, 2013) stress the need for safety assess- ment of food contaminants and environmental pollutants. Cur- rent immunotoxicity screening still focuses on rodent in vivo models. Since the implementation of REACH, that requires the evaluation of chemical hazards for chemicals of which the yearly production exceeds 1 tonne, progress has been made towards development of in vitro alternatives for immunotoxicity testing (EC, 2006). In our previous work, using the in vitro Jurkat T cell model, we identiﬁed and validated 25 biomarker genes representative for different mechanisms underlying direct immunotoxicity (Shao et al., 2013, 2014) (Table 1). Jurkat T cells were chosen as they are easy to work with, cheap, readily available and of human or- igin, making extrapolation to human hazard easier than an ani- mal cell model. Jurkat cells have also been applied in assessing the effect of compounds on mitogen-induced proliferation and migration (Fischer et al., 2004; Fernandez-Riejos et al., 2008). On the basis of the outcome of the previous study, two impor- tant questions were raised. First, how does the screening system perform towards new classes of immunotoxicants that have not been tested yet? This question is relevant because the bio- markers are based on a set of chemicals belonging to a variety of compound classes such as metals, mycotoxins, herbicides, * Correspondence to: A. A. C. M.

Therefore, how this biomarker- based system will perform when exposed to a compound from a class that has not been tested should be further investigated. Second, only a limited number of non-immunotoxic compounds has been tested, which resulted in a less satisfactory speciﬁcity. How will this screening system perform when more non- immunotoxicants are included? To answer these important issues, new compounds were searched for in literature and reports. In total we selected nine known immunotoxicants, ﬁve known non-immunotoxicants and four compounds for which it was not fully established whether they are immunotoxic or not (Table 2). Known immunotoxicants from new compound classes include the chloropropanol food contaminant 2,3-dichloro-1-propanol (2,3-DCP) (Lu et al., 2013), the biological anti-CD3 (Ishiguro and Xavier 2004; Weetall et al., 2002), the organophosphorus pesticide chlorpyrifos which causes immunotoxicity in T cells and natural killer cells (Dunier et al., 1991; Noworyta-Glowacka et al., 2012), the lectin phytohaemagglutinin (PHA-L) (Mitsuishi and the poly-brominated ﬂame-retardant et al., 1986) tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) (Pullen et al., 2003; Birnbaum and Staskal, 2004). In addition, immunotoxic compounds from classes insecticides cypermethrin and aldicarb (Jin et al., 2011), and the mycotoxin zearalenone (Abbes et al., 2013).The insecticide aldicarb in- creased T cell populations in women drinking contaminated tested before were included: the

water (Mirkin et al., 1990), however, aldicarb was assessed to be non-immunotoxic in mice (Thomas et al., 1987). Arsenic triox- ide was already tested before in the Jurkat screening model and is tested again as a positive control as it showed the largest effects on the biomarker genes (Shao et al., 2013). As the results of compounds that have been tested as non- immunotoxic are less likely to be published, a publication bias exists for non-immunotoxic compounds. Therefore, searches for non-immunotoxicants also concerned governmental reports such as those from the European CHemicals Agency (ECHA) and the Australian Pesticides and the Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA). Known non-immunotoxicants selected in this study were ametoctradin (APVMA), arsenobetaine (Sakurai et al., 2004; Borak and Hosgood, 2007), carbon tetrachloride (CCL4) (Smialowicz et al., 1991), diuron (EC, 2006) and benzo-e-pyrene (White et al., 2012). of which contains immunotoxicity has not been deﬁnitively observed. Four com- pounds were included: racecadotril sunset (Hidrasec), chlorantraniliprole (trade name Rynaxypyr) and imidacloprid. Sunset yellow FCF is a food contaminant that was tested immunotoxic in mice (Hashem et al., 2010; Yadav et al., 2013). Sunset yellow FCF reduced the number of monocytes to 50% in mice in vivo without affecting other immune cells (Hashem et al., 2010). Hidrasec, which is used as a treatment for diarrhoea, was assessed to be non-immunotoxic in rodents yellow FCF, compounds category third A wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/jat Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Although the informa- tion leaﬂet mentions that up to 1% of the users suffered from a rash and erythema, which are clinical signs of hypersensitivity of the human skin to chemicals. Also chlorantraniliprole was evaluated as non-immunotoxic in rodents (non-peer reviewed publications). However, chlorantraniliprole is suspected to act on the release of calcium from intracellular calcium stores (Lahm et al., 2005) which is an important process in T cell activation. Therefore it was decided to include this drug in the present study as well. Imidacloprid is a neonicotinoid insecticide and has been tested immunotoxic in rats and mice (Badgujar et al., 2013; Gawade et al., 2013). Nevertheless, there is little known about the effects of this compound on the hu- man immune system and on human-derived immune cells in vitro. The aim of this study is twofold. The ﬁrst aim is to validate the 25 biomarkers previously identiﬁed by screening new immunotoxic and non-immunotoxic compounds. In our previ- ous study, the sensitivity, speciﬁcity and accuracy were 88%, 67% and 85%, respectively (Shao et al., 2014). The low speciﬁcity was likely as a result of the fact that only three non-immunotoxic controls were examined. Therefore, in the present work, the performance of the classiﬁer genes is tested using an ex- tended set of non-immunotoxic controls. The second aim is to predict the immunotoxicity of ﬁve compounds for which insufﬁcient data are available. Next to the 25 marker genes identiﬁed before, we selected eight additional genes that are known to be biomarkers for speciﬁc processes including T cell activation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, choles- terol homeostasis and the cell cycle (Table 4). It was envis- aged that the response of these genes in combination with the 25 markers for immunotoxicity will provide insight in to the mechanisms of action of the compounds. For assessing the mRNA expression response of the 33 genes to the 19 compounds in Jurkat cells, we used a Fluidigm high-throughput PCR system, which has proven to be a fast and reliable system to study gene expression (Shao et al., 2014). The set of 25 biomarkers yielded a sensitivity of 100%, speciﬁcity of 80% and accuracy of 93%. This performance was better than that obtained in the previous valida- tion experiment (Shao et al., 2014). Materials and Methods Chemicals All chemicals were ordered from Sigma-Aldrich (Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands), except anti-CD3 and IgG isotype control (Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Cell Culture The human T-lymphocyte cell line (Jurkat) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Jurkat cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1 mM non- essential amino acids, 100 U ml–1 penicillin and 100 μg ml–1 strep- tomycin (Invitrogen Life Science, Breda, The Netherlands). Cells were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a humidiﬁed atmosphere. The medium was refreshed three times a week. ATPlite Assay Cell viability was tested using the ATPlite assay (Perkin Elmer, Oosterhout, The Netherlands) which is based on the production of light caused by the reaction of ATP with luciferase and D-luciferin. The emitted light is proportional to the amount of ATP, which is a marker for cell viability. Jurkat cells were plated 20 h before exposure in a 96-well plate (20 000 cells per well). Exposure was done in triplicate in 100 μl medium in 96 well plates for 24 h to increasing concentrations of compounds, or to the vehicle controls. After exposure, the assay was performed according the manufacturer’s protocol. J. Appl. Toxicol. 2015; 35: 831– Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/jat

Exposures Jurkat cells (passage number between 15 and 19) were seeded in six-well plates containing 2.7 ml (750 000 cells per well) per well. After growing the cells for 20 h, exposure was initiated by adding 0.3 ml of medium containing a non-cytotoxic concentra- tion of the compounds or vehicle controls. Subsequently, cells were exposed to the compounds for 6 h. The maximum ﬁnal di- methyl sulfoxide (DMSO) concentration in the medium was 0.1% (v/v) for all the samples which had no effect on viability. For each compound, exposures were performed on three different days. IgG was used as a control for the anti-CD3 exposures. DMSO was not present in either anti-CD3 or IgG treatments. RNA Isolation and Quality Control After exposure, removed after the culture medium was centrifugation of the cell suspension (5 min at 300 g, 4 °C). The resulting cell pellet was homogenized in 600 μl lysis buffer (RLT) (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands) supplemented with 10% β-mercaptoethanol and stored at –80 °C until further pro- cessing. RNA was isolated with the QIAshredder kit (Qiagen) ac- cording to the manufacturer’s protocol. Subsequently, RNA was puriﬁed using the mRNeasy kit (Qiagen) including DNase treat- ment according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA yield was Isogen Life assessed spectrophotometrically (NanoDrop 2000; Science, De Meern, The Netherlands). Quantitative Real Time–PCR Veriﬁcation Detection of biomarker gene expression changes was performed at ServiceXS (ServiceXS B.V., Leiden, The Netherlands) using the 96.96 BioMark™ Dynamic Array for Real-Time PCR (Fluidigm Corporation, San Francisco, CA, USA), according to the manufac- turer’s instructions. cDNA samples were synthesized using a miScript Reverse Transcription kit according to the manufac- turer’s protocol (Qiagen). Before use on the BioMark™ array, the cDNA was ﬁrst subjected to 14 cycles of Speciﬁc Target Ampliﬁcation (STA) using a 0.2× mixture of all Taqman Gene Expression assays in combination with the Taqman PreAmp Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), followed by ﬁve-fold dilution. Water was included as No Template Control (NTC) at the indi- cated positions. The No Template Controls were also included in the STA reaction, to serve as a true negative control for the entire procedure. After the 5× dilution, thermal cycling and P. C. J. Schmeits et al. real-time imaging of the BioMark™ array was done on the BioMark™ instrument, and threshold cycle (Ct) values were ex- tracted using the BioMark™ Real-Time PCR analysis software. Ct values were used to determine compound effects on mRNA ex- pression levels. Pair-wise combinations of all samples were made with each of the assays in duplicate on the array. The empty as- say positions were ﬁlled with No Assay Controls, in which the 20× assay mix was substituted with water. The default Taqman PCR protocol was used on the BioMark™ instrument with an an- nealing temperature of 60 °C and a total of 35 cycles of PCR. Analyzes of qRT–PCR Data At the end of each PCR cycle, data were collected from the reaction chambers on each array, and Ct values were extracted using the BioMark™ RT–PCR analysis software version 3.0.2. The quality threshold was set at 0.65 (default value). The relative mRNA expression levels were calculated for each individual sample by applying the delta-delta-CT method. Three genes were selected as reference genes, based on the low vari- ability of the relative mRNA expression levels quantiﬁed by the microarrays performed before (Shao et al., 2013), being beta-2- macroglobulin (B2M, highly abundant), Golgi to ER trafﬁc protein 4 (GET4, lowly abundant) and phosphatidylinositol glycan an- chor biosynthesis class G1 (PIGG). Compounds are considered immunotoxic when one or more of the classiﬁer genes are affected by factor ≥ 2 vs. the control in at least two out of three replicates. Clustering of genes was performed using Cluster v3.0 (uncentered correlation; average linkage clustering) devel- oped by Stanford University. Treeview was used for visualization of the clustering analysis. Functional Interpretation Based on ToxPi Analysis The 25 classiﬁers were divided into eight functional classes (Table 3). The effects of each compound on these functional themes were visualized using ToxPi software from the US EPA (Reif et al., 2013). The mRNA levels of the 25 classiﬁer genes of the 16 compounds were used as the input for ToxPi software. ToxPi calculates a ToxPi score for each compound on each func- tional theme, and ranks the compounds by their overall ToxPi scores. The ToxPi score (between 0 to 1) is calculated by dividing the results of each chemical on the genes that are involved in this functional theme by the maximum results on the same genes from the 16 compounds.

J. Appl. Toxicol. 2015; 35: 831– Towards an animal-free testing strategy for direct immunotoxicity qRT–PCR on Additional Genes for Functional Conﬁrmation Eight genes were selected for additional qRT–PCR experiments to conﬁrm the functional themes that were used in ToxPi analyzes. These genes were involved in processes such as T cell activation, apoptosis, ER stress, cholesterol homeostasis, immune regulation, cell cycle and regulation of transcription (Table 4). The qRT-PCR procedure was identical to the methods described above. Hierarchical Clustering Hierarchical clustering was performed with the programs Cluster (uncentered correlation; average linkage clustering) and Treeview (Eisen et al., 1998). Red and green indicate up- and downregulation vs. average expression of control samples. Results ATPlite Assay The viability of Jurkat cells that were exposed to the different compounds was assessed by means of the ATPlite assay. Com- pound concentrations that lead to a decrease in viability of 20% or less after 24-h incubation (CV80) were selected for gene expression analysis, as published previously (Schmeits et al., 2013). For some compounds, the viability did not decrease after exposure to the highest concentration not giving rise to precip- itation. In that case, this highest concentration was taken for fur- ther analysis. An overview of the viability data is presented in Fig. 1. The concentrations that were selected for exposures are listed in Table 2. Biomarker Characteristics The qRT–PCR data were subjected to hierarchical clustering analysis (the outcome is visualized in the heat-map in Fig. 2). The results of the qRT–PCR analysis are also shown in Supple- mentary Fig. S1. All nine known immunotoxicant are classiﬁed as immunotoxic based on the 25 gene markers. The sensitivity is therefore 100%. For the known non-immunotoxicants, four out of ﬁve were correctly classiﬁed as non-immunotoxic. Benzo-e-pyrene downregulated one gene (HMGCS1) and is con- sequently classiﬁed as false positive. The speciﬁcity of this set is therefore 80%. The overall accuracy is 93%.The performance characteristics of the present analysis are also shown in Supple- mentary Table S1. Compounds with Unknown Immunotoxic Properties This study included four compounds for which the immunotoxic properties have not been precisely described. The reason for in- cluding these compounds was to verify whether the expression proﬁles of these 25 marker genes can provide more insight into the modes of action and point towards possible immunotoxic properties of these compounds. Chlorantraniliprole upregulates two genes (GPR18 and SLC7A11) and is classiﬁed as immunotoxic. Hidrasec upregulates seven genes and downregulates one and is also classiﬁed as immunotoxic. Imidacloprid and Sunset yellow do not affect any of the genes and are therefore considered not immunotoxic. ToxPi Analyzes We categorized the 25 candidate classiﬁer genes into eight func- tional themes, based on the major GO processes and molecular functions that these genes are involved in (Table 3). The ToxPi tool was then used to gain insight into the modes of action of the compounds. Results of this analysis are shown in pie graphs in Fig. 3. A ﬁrst observation is that all compounds affected pro- tein metabolism to an almost similar degree. Based on similari- ties in ToxPi results, the compounds could be classiﬁed into three groups. The ﬁrst group was formed by zearalenone, Hidrasec and As2O3 which all affected genes in cellular signal transduction and cellular stress responses (panel A). Next to these similarities, zearalenone affects immune regulation and Hidrasec affects retinoic acid metabolism which are processes that are hardly affected by the other two compounds. Two compounds with almost a similar pie graph, but no sim- ilarities in structure are 2,3-DCP and cypermethrin (panel B). Both compounds affect protein metabolism and cholesterol metabo- In addition, cypermethrin affects immune lism and transport. regulation and transcription regulation that are not or to a lesser extent regulated by 2,3-DCP. ToxPi analysis of four compounds, chlorpyrifos, benzo-e-pyrene, aldicarb and anti-CD3, resulted in similar pie graphs (panel C). These four compounds all affect cholesterol metabolism and transport, protein metabolism and transcription regulation, and to a lesser extent retinoic acid me- tabolism and immune regulation.

Effects on Mode of Action (MOA) Signature Genes In order to validate the MOAs identiﬁed with the present study, we also performed qRT–PCR for all compounds on eight addi- tional genes with known functions. An overview of the primers for these genes is given in Table 4. Seven compounds resulted in signiﬁcantly altered expression of at least one of the eight genes. The results of the PCR experiments for these seven com- pounds are visualized as bar graphs in Fig. 4. PHA-L upregulated the early T cell activation marker CD69 (Ziegler et al., 1994), which corresponds to the mechanism of action of T cell activa- tion. CD69 was also upregulated by TBBPA which indicates that this compound induces T cell activation as well. TBBPA also in- duced expression of HERPUD1, a known marker for an induced

Other compounds that HERPUD1 and are thus likely to induce ER stress are Hidrasec and 2,3-DCP. 2,3-DCP downregulated SQLE, which is involved in cholesterol metabolism and transport (Bonne et al., 2002). This de- crease of cholesterol metabolism supports the biological interpre- tation based on the 25 classiﬁer genes for 2,3-DCP in Fig. 3A. SQLE was also downregulated by anti-CD3 and zearalenone, and upreg- ulated by chlorpyrifos and hidrasec which is in agreement with the results shown in Fig. 3A, B. SGK1 codes for a protein that is in- volved in cell growth, survival, migration and the cellular stress re- sponse (Amato et al., 2009). SGK1 was upregulated by anti-CD and chlorpyrifos. Hidrasec downregulated LGALS1, a gene that is involved in the cell cycle and apoptosis, which also supports the outcome of ToxPi analysis. LGALS1 was also downregulated by chlorpyrifos and upregulated by anti-CD3, however, regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis was not obvious from the pie graphs for these compounds (Fig. 3). Of the compounds that were immunotoxic based on the clas- siﬁers, As2O3, aldicarb and cypermethrin did not affect any of the additional genes. Furthermore, benzo-e-pyrene, the false positive as based on the 25 identiﬁers had also no effect on these additional genes. Moreover, the compounds selected as non-immunotoxic did not change the expression of any of the eight additional genes. Discussion The identiﬁcation and validation of the 25 classiﬁer genes was performed previously on a training set of 36 immunotoxic and 8 non-immunotoxic compounds, and an external veriﬁcation set of 17 immunotoxic and 3 non-immunotoxic compounds (Shao et al., 2014). The classiﬁers were chosen in such a way that they covered a broad range of molecular mechanisms of action. The present study was designed for two purposes, being (1) the 25 classiﬁers with additional further validation of immunotoxicants and non-immunotoxic control compounds, and (2) application of the classiﬁers to screen a group of com- pounds for which human immunotoxicity has not yet been fully established. For the ﬁrst purpose, we exposed Jurkat cells to nine known immunotoxicants and ﬁve known non-immunotoxicants. These compounds included new compound classes that have wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/jat Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. J. Appl. Toxicol. 2015; 35: 831–

Towards an animal-free testing strategy for direct immunotoxicity In this second round of validation, not tested before, such as the polybrominated ﬂame retardant TBBPA and the biological anti-CD3. The four compounds the second purpose were the neonicotinoid selected for imidacloprid, the anti- the insecticide chlorantraniliprole, diarrheal drug hidrasec and the food additive Sunset yellow the 25 classiﬁers FCF. generated a higher sensitivity (100% vs. 88%), speciﬁcity (80% vs. 67 %) and overall accuracy (93% vs. 85 %) than obtained in our previous validation (Shao et al., 2014). When the results of our present study were combined with those of Shao et al. (2014), the sensitivity, speciﬁcity and accuracy would be 91%, 71% and 85%, respectively. In addition, we show that the classiﬁers correctly predicted the immunotoxicity of compounds from classes not tested before in the Jurkat assay including TBBPA, anti CD3, chlorpyrifos, PHA-L and 2,3-DCP. This current exercise resulted in only one false positive (benzo-e-pyrene). Benzo-e-pyrene is a structural analogue of benzo-a-pyrene which is a known immunotoxicant (Boorman et al., 1982). Although benzo-e-pyrene is used as a non- immunosuppressive control for polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) exposure (Davila et al., 1999), some studies indicate slight immunotoxic effects of benzo-e-pyrene (Krieger et al., 1995; Davila et al., 1996). The only gene that was regulated by benzo-e-pyrene was HMGCS1, which is regulated in cholesterol metabolism and transport (Horton et al., 2002). We investigated possible mode of actions of the test com- pounds using ToxPi analysis based on the expression of the classiﬁer genes. In addition, we performed PCR on eight addi- tional genes, in order to support the putative MOAs we identi- ﬁed with the 25 classiﬁers. None of the non-immunotoxic compounds in the present study affected the expression of the eight additional genes tested. We determined the fold changes in expression of these eight additional genes regarding the compounds of the previous study (Shao et al., 2014). Also in this study the non-immunotoxic compounds did not alter the ex- pression of any of the eight additional genes (results not shown). TBBPA is known to induce oxidative stress followed by DNA damage (Choi et al., 2011) and stimulate immune cells (Koike et al., 2013). In our study, TBBPA induced expression of the T cell activation marker CD69, which corresponds to the results of Koike et al. (2013), but also upregulates ER stress/UPR gene HERPUD1 (Hori et al., 2004), which is a new ﬁnding (Fig. 4). In ad- dition, TBBPA upregulated the pro-apoptosis marker CHAC (Mungrue et al., 2009) almost four times. Furthermore, TBBPA is known to induce cell death (in Sertoli cells) by affecting calcium homeostasis (Ogunbayo et al., 2008). Disruption of calcium ho- meostasis in T cells may lead to ER stress (Gwack et al., 2007; Katika et al., 2012a, 2012b). Cells that do not recover from ER stress will undergo apoptotic events. Induction of ER stress is not limited to immune cells; however, immune cells are more sensitive to ER stress inducing compounds such as deoxynivalenol and tributyltin oxide. Previously we dem- onstrated that T cells are more sensitive because of the fact that ER stress leads to a leakage of calcium ions from the ER, leading to a calcium signal that in turn generates a T cell activation re- sponse, which is a measure for immunotoxicity (Katika et al., 2012a, 2012b; Schmeits et al., 2014). Although ER stress may occur in other cells as well (at higher concentrations than in immune cells), in those cells this will not lead to a T cell activation response. the mechanism by which the mycotoxin zearalenone exerts its immunotoxicity is not clear. We show that responses, zearalenone affects genes in cellular Currently, stress cholesterol metabolism/transport, immune regulation, cellular signal transduction, cell cycle and apoptosis and transcription. In addition, zearalenone downregulated one of the eight addi- tional genes tested, SQLE, which is involved in cholesterol me- tabolism. The fact that some of the immunotoxic compounds affect genes involved in cholesterol metabolism might very well reﬂect response to disruption of cholesterol homeostasis. the cellular Based on our results obtained with the 25 classiﬁer genes, 2,3- DCP mainly affects cholesterol metabolism and transport and protein metabolism. PCR analysis of additional genes, such as HERPUD1 and SQLE, supported these ﬁndings. A previous study indicated that 2,3-DCP inhibits T cell activation and downregulates activation of transduction pathways in vitro (mouse T cells puriﬁed from splenocytes) and mice in vivo (Lu et al., 2013). However, 2,3-DCP did not signiﬁcantly affect expres- sion of the T cell activation marker CD69 in the present study. This is most likely caused by the fact that Jurkat cells generally were cultured without stimulus (PHA/LPS). An inhibition of T cell activation is therefore hard to detect. Of found that chlorpyrifos In the present study, chlorpyrifos induces cellular stress responses and cholesterol biosynthesis in Jurkat T cells. Previous studies induced oxidative stress (Gultekin et al., 2001; Ambali et al., 2007). Also, chlorpyrifos induces hyperlipidaemia, a state in which cholesterol synthesis is elevated in rats (Acker and Nogueira, 2012) which is in line with the results obtained in our study. the four compounds that might be immunotoxic, chlorantraniliprole and Hidrasec were classiﬁed as immunotoxic, and the other two (imidacloprid and Sunset yellow) as non- immunotoxic, as based on the genetic markers used in this Jurkat study. Imidacloprid has been tested immunotoxic in rats and mice in vivo (Badgujar et al., 2013; Gawade et al., 2013). No data were available on human immune cells. Imidacloprid does not affect any of the 25 classiﬁers or eight additional genes tested in this study. Sunset yellow is known to affect monocytes but no other blood cells in mice in vivo (Hashem et al., 2010). Ap- parently, Sunset yellow is also not toxic for human Jurkat T cells. This result points to the limitation of the current assay that com- pounds targeting types of immune cells other than T cells might be not detected. Both chlorantraniliprole and Hidrasec were assessed non-immunotoxic in rodent immunotoxicity studies. The discrepancy between the outcome of the animal studies and the current Jurkat study with these compounds might be as a result of inter-species differences. It is generally recognized that the predictability of rodent studies for human toxicity is rather low (Shanks et al., 2009). For this reason, the US National Research Council, and other organisations, developed a future vision in which animal models are being replaced by human in vitro models Schmidt (2009). Chlorantraniliprole is suspected to act on release of calcium from intracellular calcium stores (Lahm et al., 2005) that is known to lead to T cell activation in T cells (Gwack et al., 2007; Katika et al., 2012a, 2012b). Chlorantraniliprole mainly affects cellular stress and signal response pathways in our present experiments. One of the genes upregulated by chlorantraniliprole is SLC7A11 (alias XCT). SLC7A represents the rate limiting step of glutathione synthesis, and overexpression of SLC7A11 reduces the need for calcium for early cell cycle progression in the early cell cycle (Lastro et al., 2008). In conclusion, we have proven the good prediction perfor- mance of the Jurkat T cell screening system based on 25 classi- ﬁers when challenged by new classes of immunotoxicants. The

sensitivity, speciﬁcity and accuracy were even slightly higher in the present study as compared with the previous study. In addition to its use for predicting direct immunotoxicity, this set of genes can be exploited to give indications for the modes of action of compounds. This system however may not detect compounds that exert immunotoxic action on other immune cells than T cells, which likely is the case for Sunset yellow. Therefore, for immunotoxicity screening not on itself but as part of an inte- grated testing strategy. line is a valuable model the Jurkat T cell Acknowledgments This study was ﬁnancially supported by the Netherlands Geno- mics Initiative, the Netherlands Toxicogenomics Centre (grant 05060510).
