European Journal of Histochemistry 2020; volume 64: Chronic cypermethrin exposure alters mouse embryonic stem cell growth kinetics, induces Phase II detoxification response and affects pluripotency  and differentiation gene expression Paola Rebuzzini,1 Cinzia Civello,1 Edouard Nantia Akono,2 Lorenzo Fassina,3,4 Maurizio Zuccotti,1,4 Silvia Garagna1, 1Department of Biology and Biotechnology “Lazzaro Spallanzani”, University of Pavia, Italy 2Department of Biochemistry, University of Bamenda, Bambili, Cameroon 3Department of Electrical, Computer and Biomedical Engineering, University of Pavia, Italy 4Centre for Health Technologies (C.H.T.), University of Pavia, Italy T C A R T S B A Worldwide  uncontrolled  use  of  synthetic  pyrethroids  contaminates  water  and  soil  leading  to  health  hazards. Cypermethrin (CYP), the most used pyrethroid, induces detrimental effects on adults and embryos at different stages of development of several vertebrate species. In Mammals, CYP-induced alterations have been previ- ously described in adult somatic cells and in post-implantation embryos. It remains unknown whether CYP has effects during pre-implantation development. Studies to access pre-implantation embryo toxicity are compli- cated by the restricted number of blastocysts that may be obtained, either in vivo or in vitro. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are an in vitro model study that overcomes these limitations, as millions of pluripotent cells are available to the analysis. Also, ESCs maintain the same pluripotency characteristics and differentiation capacity of the inner cell mass (ICM) present in the blastocyst, from which they derive. In this work, using mouse R ESCs,  we  studied  CYP-induced  cell  death,  ROS  production,  the  activation  of  oxidative  stress-related  and detoxification responses and the population growth kinetics following 72 h exposure at the 0.3 mM LD50 dose. Also, the expression levels of pluripotency genes in exposed ESCs and of markers of the three germ layers after their differentiation into embryoid bodies (EBs) were determined. Two apoptotic waves were observed at 12- 24 h and at 72 h. The increase of ROS production, at 24 h until the end of the culture period, was accompanied by the induction, at 48 h, of redox-related Cat, Sod1, Sod2, Gpx1 and Gpx4 genes. Up-regulation of Cyp1b1, but not of Cyp1a1, phase I gene was detected at 72 h and induction of Nqo1, Gsta1 and Ugt1a6 phase II genes began at 24 h exposure. The results show that exposed R1 ESCs activate oxidative stress-related and detoxifi- cation responses, although not sufficient, during the culture period tested, to warrant recovery of the growth rate observed in untreated cells. Also, CYP exposure altered the expression of Oct-4 and Nanog pluripotency genes in ESCs and, when differentiated into EBs, the expression of Fgf5, Brachyury and Foxa2, early markers of the ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm germ layers, respectively. NIH/3T3 cells, a differentiated cell line of embryonic origin, were used for comparison.

Introduction Synthetic  pyrethroids  are  the  most  worldwide  diffused  pesti- cides,  largely  used  since  the  ‘80s  in  households  and  agriculture because of their effectiveness and low toxicity compared to other insecticides,  such  as  organophosphorus  and  carbamic  ester  com- pounds.2,3 As  a  result  of  their  diffusion  and  uncontrolled  use, pyrethroids,  by  contaminating  water  and  soil,  have  entered  the food  chain3,4-7 becoming  a  serious  human  health  hazard. Cypermethrin (CYP), a type II pyrethroid insecticide, classified by the World Health Organization as moderately hazardous (class II), is the most widely used against a broad range of insects.9- CYP  detrimental  effects  have  been  described  on  adults  and during  embryonic  development  of  several  vertebrate  species. Specifically,  earlier  studies  demonstrated  that  CYP  generates oxidative  stress  and  apoptosis  in  fish  liver,12-14 retina,15 kidney rat  brain  and  liver17 cells  and  also  in  mouse and  gill, macrophages.18 In the mouse, by impairing endometrial receptivi- ty, CYP severely reduces embryo implantation. It remains however unknown whether CYP has effects during pre-implantation, a developmental window with three main critical steps. The first occurs at the time of embryonic genome activation (2-cell or 4-cell stage in mouse and human, respectively)20, the sec- ond when the embryo reaches the morula stage,20 followed by the most critical at the blastocyst stage, when, in our species, the great majority of embryos is lost.21 Pre-implantation embryonic loss is either a consequence of a functional damage to the endometrium or to the cell lines that make up the blastocyst, i.e., the trophectoderm or the inner cell mass (ICM), which will contribute, respectively, to  the  extra-embryonic  tissue  (e.g.,  placenta)  or  to  the  foetus. A damage to the ICM cells, when not selective against the embryo, could, however, cause serious damage to the foetus or appear much later in development, childhood or adulthood. Despite the blastocyst being one of the most vulnerable devel- opmental stage in the life of a new individual, studies to access the embryo-toxicity of test substances, performed on model animals, are  complicated  by  the  required  experimental  setting  and  the restricted  number  of  blastocysts  that  may  be  obtained,  either  in vivo or in vitro, for each single experiment. To this regard, embry- onic stem cells (ESCs) are an in vitro model study that overcomes these  limitations,  as  for  each  experiment  millions  of  pluripotent cells are available to the analysis of the test substance. ESCs main- tain  the  same  pluripotency  characteristics  and  differentiation capacity of the ICM from which they derive.22- In this work, using mouse ESCs (mESCs) as an in vitro model of the blastocyst’s ICM, we studied CYP-induced alterations that, in Mammals, have been previously described in adult somatic cells and  in  post-implantation  embryos.  Specifically,  cell  growth,  cell death,  ROS  production  and  the  activation  of  a  detoxification response were analysed in mESCs and NIH/3T3 cells, the latter, a differentiated cell line of embryonic origin, used for comparison. Also,  the  differentiation  potential  of  exposed  mESCs  was  deter- mined through their development into embryoid bodies (EBs). Materials and Methods Cells and cell cultures MA,  USA),  2  mM  L-glutamine,  1x  non-essential  amino  acids, 0.5% penicillin/streptomycin (all from Life Technology, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 0.1 mM b-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,  USA)  and  500  U/ml  ESGRO-LIF  (Millipore,  Burlington, MA, USA). The STO cell line (American Type Culture Collection CRL-2225),  used  as  feeder-layer,  was  maintained  in  DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich)  supplemented  with  10%  FBS,  4  mM  L-glu- tamine,  1x  non-essential  amino  acids,  0.5%  penicillin/strepto- mycin  (all  from  Life  Technology),  0.1  mM  b-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.2 mg/mL geneticin (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells  were  routinely  passaged  with  0.25%  trypsin  every  2- days, alternating a passage on STO feeder cells with two passages on gelatin-coated 100×20 mm Petri dishes. The NIH/3T3 cell line, hereafter 3T3 (a generous gift by Prof. Giulotto, Department of Biology and Biotechnology, University of Pavia),  was  cultured  in  DMEM  (Sigma-Aldrich)  supplemented with 10% FBS, 4 mM L-glutamine, 1x non-essential amino acids, 0.5%  penicillin/streptomycin  (all  from  Life  Technology)  and  0. mM  b-mercaptoethanol  (Sigma-Aldrich).  Cells  were  routinely passaged with 0.25% trypsin every 2-3 days. Cypermethrin preparation a-cypermethrin  [α-Cyano-(3-phenoxyphenyl)-methyl  3-(2,2- dichlorovinyl)-2,2-dimethyl  cyclopropane  carboxylate]  (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) was dissolved to a final concentration of 100 mM in  dimethyl  sulfoxide  (DMSO).  The  solution  was  maintained  at  -20°C  and  renewed  every  7  days,  to  ensure  the  stability  of  the molecule, according to manufacturer instructions. Determination of CYP LD50 dose CYP  toxicity  was  carried  out  by  measuring  the  alteration  of growth of a massive cell culture, as described by Rebuzzini et al. Briefly,  3×104 R1  and  3T3  cells  were  seeded  in  6  cm  Petri  dish (Corning) and exposed to increasing concentrations of CYP (0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 or 1 mM) or to 0.01% DMSO (Control, CTR). After 72 h, the cells were collected in PBS 1x, pelleted at 1200 rpm for 8 min, lysed in 0.1 M NaOH and incubated at 50ºC in  water  bath  for  30  min. The  number  of  cells  was  estimated  by measuring the absorbance of the lysate at 260 nm. Cell growth curve determination R1 and 3T3 cells were seeded at a density of 5×104 and 8×104, respectively, and incubated with the determined CYP LD50 concen- tration for 72 h. Cells were harvested after 8, 24, 48 and 72 h, and counted using a Bürker chamber. Apoptosis Annexin V assay The ApopNexinTM FITC  and  propidium  iodide  (PI)  kit  assay (Merck  Millipore)  was  used  to  detect  apoptosis  after  CYP  treat- ment. Briefly, 3T3 (1.5×104 cells) and R1 (105 cells) were seeded in  6  cm  Petri  dishes  and  exposed  to  0.6  mM  and  0.3  mM  CYP, respectively, for 8 (only 3T3), 12 (only R1), 24, 48 and 72 h. Cells were  harvested  according  to  the  manufacturer  instructions  and analysed, after staining, by bivariate flow cytometry [FITC band in FL1 and PI band in the FL3 channel, flow cytometer FACS Lyric BD (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA)]. A minimum of 50,000 events was acquired for each sample. Data were processed, plotted  and  analysed  using  the  BD  FACSuiteTM flow  cytometer software. The R1 mESC line (kindly provided by Dr. Nagy from Samuel Lunenfeld  Research  Institute,  Mount  Sinai  Hospital,  Toronto, Ontario, Canada) was cultivated as reported in Rebuzzini et al. Briefly, cells were grown in Knockout DMEM supplemented with 15%  ESC  Qualified  FBS  (Thermo  Fisher  Scientific,  Waltham, Reactive oxygen species quantification The  cell-permeant  2’,7’-dichlorodihydrofluorescein  diacetate (H2DCFDA)  fluorescent  probe  (Thermo  Fisher  Scientific)  was used to evaluate the intracellular levels of ROS. R1 (105 cells) and fibroblast 3T3 (2×105 cells) were seeded in 10 cm Petri dishes and [European Journal of Histochemistry 2020; 64:3084] [page 63]

exposed to 0.3 mM or 0.6 mM CYP, respectively, for 8 (3T3 only), 12 (R1 only), 24, 48 and 72 h (both cell lines). Then, cells were collected, centrifuged at 500 rpm for 5 min and resuspended in 1x PBS solution containing 10 µM H2DCFDA. The mixture was incu- bated at 37ºC for 30 min under dark conditions. The analyses of the samples were performed using a flow cytometer FACS Lyric BD (BD Biosciences). A minimum of 50,000 events were acquired for each sample. Data were processed, plotted and analysed using the BD FACSuiteTM flow cytometer software. Cell cycle analysis R1 (105 cells) and fibroblast 3T3 (2×105 cells) were seeded in 10  cm  Petri  dishes  and  exposed  to  0.3  mM  and  0.6  mM  CYP, respectively. After 8 (3T3), 12 (R1), 24, 48 and 72 h, the cells were harvested, washed in 1x PBS and stained with 1.5 ml of 50 µg/ml propidium iodide (PI), containing 100 U/ml of RNase and 0.05% Igepal (Sigma-Aldrich). The  analyses  of  the  samples  were  performed  using  a  flow cytometer  FACS  Lyric  BD  (BD  Biosciences).  A  minimum  of 50,000  events  were  acquired  for  each  sample.  Data  were  pro- cessed,  plotted  and  analysed  using  the  BD  FACSuiteTM flow cytometer software. Embryoid bodies formation CTR  and  CYP-exposed  ESCs  were  differentiated  into  EBs, following  culture  in  the  absence  of  LIF,  using  the  hanging  drop protocol.27 After 3 days of culture, EBs were transferred into a mm 0.1% agarose-coated Petri dish (Corning); after 2 more days, RNA was collected from about 100 EBs. RNA extraction, reverse transcription and real-time PCR Total RNA was extracted from R1 (105 cells) and 3T3 (2× cells) cells after 8 (3T3), 12 (R1), 24, 48 and 72 h of CYP exposure and  from  EBs  at  the  end  of  the  differentiation  period  (5  days), using  GenElute  Mammalian  Total  RNA  kit  (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Reverse transcription was performed in a final volume of 20 µl reaction mixture contain- ing  1  µg  of  RNA,  1x  PCR  buffer,  5  mM  MgCl2,  4  mM  of  each dNTP, 0.625 µM oligo d(T)16, 1.875 µM Random Hexamers, 20 U RNAse  inhibitor  and  50  U  MuLV  reverse  transcriptase  (Thermo Fisher  Scientific). The  amplification  programme  was  as  follows: 25°C for 10 s, 42°C for 15 s, 99°C for 5 s. One twentieth of the resulting cDNA was amplified in dupli- cate by real-time PCR in 20 µL reaction mixture with 200 nM of each  primer  (designed  with  Primer  3  software;  Supplementary Table  1)  and  MESA  GREEN  qPCR  MasterMix  Plus  for  SYBR assay no ROX sample (Eurogentec, Liege, Belgium) at 1x as final concentration.  The  amplification  reaction,  performed  in  a Rotorgene 6000 (Corbett Life Science, Sydney, Australia), for the analysis  of  catalase  (Cat),  superoxide  dismutase  1  and  2  (Sod1, Sod2), glutathione peroxidase 1 and 4 (Gpx1, Gpx4), cytochrome 1a1  (Cyp1a1),  octamer-binding  transcription  factor  4  (Oct-4), homeobox protein NANOG (Nanog), T-Box Transcription Factor T (Brachyury), fibroblast growth factor 5 (Fgf5) and forkhead box protein A2  (Foxa2)    transcripts  expression  was  as  follows:  95°C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 10 s, 60°C for 15 s, 72°C  for  20  s.  The  amplification  reaction  for  the  analysis  of cytochrome  1b1  (Cyp1b1),  NAD(P)H  quinone  dehydrogenase (Nqo1),  glutathione  S-transferase  alpha  1 (Gsta1)  and  UDP-glu- curonosyltransferase 1 a 6 (Ugt1a6) transcripts expression was as follows: 95°C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 s, 60°C for 20 s, 72°C for 60 s. The Rotorgene 6000 Series Software 1.7 was used for the com- parative  concentration  analysis.  β-2-microglobulin  (β2m)  gene expression was used for sample normalization. Statistical analysis For  each  assay,  three  independent  experiments  were  per- formed. The results were analysed using SigmaStat software. Data, expressed as mean ± SD, were analysed by the one-way ANOVA and by the post-hoc LSD test. Results We first determined the CYP dose that reduced growth of 50% (LD50);  the  LD50 was  0.3  mM  and  0.6  mM,  for  mouse  R1  ESCs (R1)  and  3T3,  respectively  (Supplementary  Figure  1);  all  the experiments  described  below  were  performed  at  these  specific doses.  The  presence  of  the  DMSO  vehicle  did  not  significantly alter cell growth of both cell lines (P>0.05) (data not shown). Cell growth kinetics R1 and 3T3 cell lines displayed different growth dynamics. A significant (P<0.003) decrease of the R1 cell number was observed up to 24 h following CYP exposure (Figure 1). Then, exposed cells grew, although at lower rate compared to CTR, as evidenced by the Figure 1. Fitted growth curves of CTR and CYP-exposed cells of R1 and 3T3 lines. Circles represent the experimental data; dotted lines are the upper and lower percentage bounds (95%). [page 64]                                             [European Journal of Histochemistry 2020; 64:3084]

significant reduction (P=0.008) of the regression slope (Figure 1); the population doubling (PD) time was higher in exposed (19.52 h) compared to that of CTR (16.21 h, as also shown earlier by Tamm et  al.29)  cells. In  3T3,  the  number  of  exposed  cells  significantly decreased  (P=0.024),  compared  to  CTR,  within  8  h  of  culture (Figure 1). Then, CTR and treated 3T3 cells grew at the same rate (P  =0.133,  comparison  of  the  regression  slopes,  Figure  1)  with similar PD time (22.78 h and 27.70 h, respectively). This PD time agrees with previous published data (http://www.nih3t3.com/) for untreated cells. To  understand  whether  the  decrease  in  cell  number  observed was  due  to  apoptosis  and/or  to  alterations  in  the  progression through the cell cycle stages, the Annexin V assay and the nuclear DNA content evaluation were used, respectively. Apoptosis Figure  2  reports  the  fraction  of  R1  and  3T3  cells  positive  to Annexin V (AnV+ early apoptotic marker), Annexin V and propid- ium iodide (AnV+/PI+, late apoptotic marker), or propidium iodide (PI+,  cell  death  marker)  after  CYP  exposure,  expressed  as  fold change relative to CTR set at 1. AnV+ and AnV+/PI+ R1 cells significantly increased after both 12 h (3.2- and 2.4-fold, respectively; P<0.05) and 24 h (1.6- and 2.2-fold,  respectively;  P<0.05)  exposure,  when  comparted  to  the CTR population (Figure 2A). At 48 h, only apoptotic PI+ cells were detected,  with  a  1.4  fold-increase  (P<0.05).  A  second  relevant wave of apoptosis was recorded after 72 h exposure with a 7.7-fold and a 5.3-fold increase of AnV+ and AnV+/PI+ cells, respectively (Figure 2A). After  8  h  exposure, AnV+ and AnV+/PI+ 3T3  cells  increased (1.5  and  1.7-fold,  respectively,  P<0.001),  while  PI+ 3T3  cells decreased (0.6-fold, P<0.05) compared to CTR (Figure 2B). After 24 h, a further increase (P<0.05) up to 2.2- and 2.1-fold for AnV+ and AnV+/PI+ cells, respectively, was observed, whereas PI+ cells were not significantly different (P>0.05) when compared to CTR. A peak (2.2-fold increase, P<0.05) of cell death was observed after 48 h, whereas at 72 h exposed cells completely recovered, showing the same degree of early or late apoptosis as that of CTR (P>0.05) (Figure 2B). Distribution of cells in the cell cycle phases Next, the nuclear DNA content during the different cell cycle phases was evaluated using a one-parametric analysis of PI-stained nuclei. In R1 CTR cells, the recorded distribution in G0/G1 (32%), in S (54%) and in G2/M (14%) phases confirms previous findings of our and other groups.30,31 When exposed to CYP, the frequency of R1  cells  distributed  within  the  three  phases  of  the  cell  cycle remained unaltered up to 24 h (Supplementary Table 2). At 48 and 72  h,  the  frequency  of  cells  in  G0/G1 significantly  decreased (P<0.001),  in  association  with  a  significant  increase  of  cells  in G2/M phase (Supplementary Table 2), suggesting an activation of a G2/M cell cycle block at both time points. About 67% of unexposed 3T3 cells were in G0/G1 phase, 14% in S phase and 18% in G2/M phase (Supplementary Table 2 and Tai et al.32). After 8 and 24 h of CYP exposure the distribution of cells in the different phases of the cell cycle remained unaltered com- pared to CTR (Supplementary Table 2), instead, at 48 h, the fre- quency of cells in G0/G1 increased (P<0.001) while the frequency of  cells  in  S  and  in  G2-phase  significantly  decreased  (P<0.001) (Supplementary Table 2), suggesting an activation of a G0/G1 block of  the  cell  cycle.  The  distribution  of  cells  in  the  three  phases returns  not  significantly  different  compared  to  CTR  after  72  h exposure.  Then,  we  determined  whether  reactive  oxygen  species (ROS) are induced by CYP. Also, we evaluated whether an antiox- idant cellular response is triggered, by analysing the expression of Cat,  Sod1,  Sod2, Gpx1 and  Gpx4 genes,  which  code  for  major antioxidant proteins against ROS. ROS production and redox-related gene expression Figure 2.

response Exposed  R1  cells  showed  1.2-fold  increase  (P<0.05)  in  ROS production beginning at 24 h culture. ROS production continues to increase  after  both  48  and  72  h  (1.3  and  1.6  fold,  respectively, P<0.05)  (Figure  3A).  In  exposed  R1  cells,  ROS  production  was paralleled  by  the  induction  (P<0.001)  of  Cat,  Sod1,  Sod2,  and Gpx4 gene expression, at 48 h culture, and also of Gpx1 (P<0.05) at 72 h (Figure 3B and Supplementary Table 3). Compared to CTR, exposed 3T3 cells displayed higher levels of ROS at 24 h and 48 h (1.3- and 1.2-fold, respectively; P<0.05) (Figure 3A), but not at 8 h and 72 h. Of the five gene transcripts (Cat,  Sod1,  Sod2,  Gpx1 and  Gpx4)  analysed,  no  difference between CTR and exposed cells was detected within 8 h, whereas, after  24  h,  cells  displayed  significant  increase  (P<0.05)  of  Cat expression and slight, but significant, decrease (P<0.05) of Gpx and  Sod2  transcripts.  Sod2  transcripts  remained  low  in  exposed cells  after  48  h  culture.  At  72  h,  slight  (P<0.05)  Cat and  Gpx induction was detected (Figure 3B and Supplementary Table 4). To  determine  if  the  detoxification  mechanisms,  known  to  be involved  in  the  processes  of  elimination  of  environmental  toxi- cants,33 were  activated  in  response  to  CYP  exposure,  the  expres- sion profile of cytochromes P450 Cyp1a1 and Cyp1b1 (AHR-reg- ulated of phase I) and Nqo1, Gsta1 and Ugt1a6 (AHR-regulated of phase II) enzymes was evaluated. Phase I and phase II gene expression response In exposed R1 mESCs, of the two Phase I genes, the level of Cyp1a1 transcripts was similar to CTR at 12 and 72 h whereas it was lower (P<0.05) at both 24 and 48 h; Cyp1b1 was down regu- lated (P<0.05) at 24 and 48 h but up regulated (P<0.001) at 72 h culture.  Ugt1a6  Phase  II  gene  was  initially  down  regulated (P<0.05), but then it was up regulated (P<0.001) from 24 h until the  end  of  the  culture  period. Also  up  regulated  (P<0.001)  were Gsta1 (from 48 h) and Nqo1 (at 72 h) (Figure 4 and Supplementary Table 3). Compared  to  CTR,  of  the  five  genes  analysed,  three  were upregulated  in  3T3  exposed  cells:  Cyp1a1 (P<0.05)  at  24  h; Ugt1a6  (P<0.001)  from  24  h,  Gsta1 (P<0.001)  from  48  h.  The expression  of  the  other  two  genes  (Cyp1b1 and  Nqo1)  remained unaltered (P>0.01) (Figure 4 and Supplementary Table 4). Pluripotency and germ cell layers gene expression When R1 mESCs were exposed to CYP for 12 and 24 h, they displayed  a  significant  reduction  (P<0.001)  of  Oct-4 and  Nanog expression compared to CTR. To the contrary, after 72 h exposure, for Oct-4,  or  48 h and 72 h  exposure,  for  Nanog,  the expression significantly  increases  (P<0.001)  (Figure  5A  and  Supplementary Table 5). The altered expression of two genes of the pluripotency core  might  influence  the  differentiation  capacity  of  exposed  R ESCs. To test whether CYP-exposed mESCs maintain their ability to form the three germ layers, they were differentiated into EBs for Figure 3. A) ROS content in R1 and 3T3 cell populations. B) Expression profile of Cat, Sod1 and 2 and of Gpx1 and 4 ROS redox- response genes, at different time points in the presence of CYP.

5 days. As expected, Fgf5, Brachyury, and Foxa2 (markers of the ectoderm,  mesoderm  and  endoderm,  respectively)  were  highly induced in CTR EBs when  compared to undifferentiated  mESCs (2.3, 60.0 and 5.9-fold change, respectively; data not shown). CYP-exposed ESCs maintain the ability to form EBs, but dis- played  altered  expression  of  the  markers  of  three  germ  layers. Specifically,  the  expression  of  Fgf5 in  EBs  obtained  from  ESCs exposed to CYP for 12 h and 72 h is similar to CTR EBs (Figure 5B;  Table  6S),  whereas  it  is  reduced  (P<0.001)  in  EBs  obtained from  ESCs  exposed  to  CYP  for  24  and  48  h.  The  number  of Brachyury gene transcripts is significant altered (P<0.001), either lower  or  higher  (Figure  5B;  Supplementary  Table  6),  in  EBs derived  from  mESCs  exposed  to  CYP  when  compared  to  CTR EBs.  Foxa2 gene  transcripts  are  significantly  (P<0.001)  overex- pressed in EBs obtained from CYP-exposed ESCs for 12, 48 and 72 h (Figure 5B and Table 6S). Discussion The  results  of  this  study  highlight  three  main  responses  of ESCs  following  exposure  to  the  pyrethroid  insecticide  cyperme- thrin: alterations of the i) cell growth kinetics; ii) phase II detoxi- fication  genes  induction;  and  iii)  expression  of  the  pluripotency and the three germ layers gene markers. Compared to control, CYP-exposed R1 ESCs display a mas- sive  45%  decrease  in  number  during  the  first  24  h,  followed  by proliferation resumption during the remaining culture period. This resumption  is  characterized  by  significant  longer  PD  time  which contributes to explain the slower growth rate. The activation of a first apoptotic wave, observed soon after 12-24 h exposure, might represent a short-term response, perhaps needed for the elimination of highly damaged cells from the population. It is well known that mESCs undertake facilitated cell death34,35 because of the lack of checkpoints  controlling  the  G1-S  and  the  intra-S30,34,36 transition Figure 4.

phases. A second wave of CYP-induced apoptosis is observed at h, when ROS production is further increased, contributing to the elimination of cells arrested in G2/M phase at 48 h and 72 h expo- sure, likely those with unrepairable damages. The increase of the production of ROS is also accompanied  by the  induction, begin- ning  at  48  h  CYP  treatment,  of  redox-related  Cat,  Sod1,  Sod2, Gpx1 and Gpx4 genes. In parallel, CYP exposure also triggers detoxification endoge- nous mechanisms,37,38 with the up-regulation of only one, Cyp1b, of the two phase I genes studied and of phase II Nqo1, Gsta1 and Ugt1a6  genes.  Interestingly,  phase  II  induction  occurs  earlier (beginning  at  24  h)  than  that  of  phase  I  genes  (at  72  h).  These results highlight a major role, in pluripotent R1 ESCs, of phase II genes  in  the  detoxification  of  pyrethroids,  including  b-cyperme- thrin,  as  shown  earlier  in  human  hepatocytes39 and  in  zebrafish embryos.40 In addition to Cyp1b1, we anticipated that the mecha- nism of detoxification of pyrethroids in undifferentiated stem cells might  be  mediated  by  members  of  the  cytochrome  P450  family other than Cyp1a1, such as Cyp9a10. Interestingly,  CYP  exposure  altered  the  expression  of  Oct- and  Nanog pluripotency  genes  in  ESCs  and,  when  differentiated into  EBs,  the  expression  of  Fgf5,  Brachyury,  and  Foxa2,  early markers  of  the  ectoderm,  mesoderm  and  endoderm  germ  layers, respectively.  Our  results  highlight,  for  the  first  time,  that pyrethroids might be able to perturb the inherent characteristics of pluripotency and differentiation capacity of ESCs. Compared  to  R1  ESCs,  the  behaviour  of  3T3  embryonic fibroblasts  to  CYP  exposure  evidences  differences  to  both  cell growth kinetics and detoxification response. In fact, these cells dis- play a mild 10% decrease in cell number within 8 h exposure, fol- lowed by return to a PD time and growth rate comparable, through- out the remaining culture period, to those of control 3T3. The pop- ulation growth rate appears to be unaffected by cell death, detected by  the  late  apoptotic  markers  at  48  h  culture,  when  the  G0/G checkpoint is activated. The growth rate recovery observed could also  have  been  facilitated  by  the  early  (24  h)  activation  of  the detoxification  phase  I  (Cyp1a1)  and  phase  II  (Ugt1a6)  response, the latter (Ugt1a6 and Gsta1) maintained until the end of the cul- ture period. The increase of ROS production, initiated at 24 h, is no longer detected at the end of the culture period, when only Cat and Gpx4, out of six redox-related genes analysed, are up-regulated. The  results  here  reported  on  3T3  cells  confirmed  previous observations that the metabolism of differentiated cells better tol- erates  the  exposure  to  toxic  molecules,42-44 when  compared  to undifferentiated cells. For example, differentiated SH-SY5Y neu- roblastoma  cells  displayed  higher  tolerance  to  all-trans-retinoic acid 42 or to inhibitors of the electron-transport chain mitochondrial complex I,44 when compared to their undifferentiated counterpart. Also, differentiated human intestinal Caco-2 cells were more resis- tant  to  some  inorganic  compounds  (i.e.,  SiO2,  ZnO),  than  the respective undifferentiated population. In  conclusion,  this  is  the  first  study  to  describe  the  adaptive response of pluripotent stem cells of embryonic origin to continu- ous exposure to CYP, one of the most common and widely used pyrethroid.  The  results  show  that  R1  ESCs  activate  oxidative stress-related and detoxification responses, although not sufficient, during the culture period tested, to warrant recovery of the growth rate observed in untreated cells. Also, our study highlights poten- tial  detrimental  effects  of  CYP  exposure  on  the  differentiation capacity of ESCs into the three germ layers, a pivotal step for the embryo proper formation. These results, obtained using the most robust in vitro model of the ICM, from which the foetus derives, anticipate possible effects exerted by CYP during pre-implantation development.
