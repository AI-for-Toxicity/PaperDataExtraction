ABSTRACT Background and Aims: Humans and animals have daily contact with various chemicals, including food additives, pesticides,  antibiotics, other veterinary drugs, and other xenobiotics. Pesticide exposure causes many health disorders. Mixed exposure to  pesticides is an important issue for human and environmental health. Methods: In this study, we have determined the cytotoxicity of chlormequat pirimiphos-methyl, glyphosate, tebuconazole,  chlorpyrifos-methyl,  deltamethrin,  and  the  mixture  of  these  six  pesticides.  We  further  investigated  the  role  of  oxidative  stress, total oxidant status (TOS), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and antioxidant defense mechanism TOS, total glutathione  (GSH) levels with the observed cytotoxicity. Results: In this study, the mixtures of pesticides reduced total antioxidant status (TAS) and GSH level one by one and in- creased the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in HUVECs, respectively. The results also showed a significant contri- bution of oxidative stress on cytotoxicity during pesticide mixture exposure. Conclusion: The findings are that pesticide mixture exposure might have an impact on human health risk at contaminated  sites and under occupational exposure conditions. Keywords: Chlorpyrifos-methyl, chlormequat, deltamethrin, glyphosate, pirimiphos-methyl, tebuconazole, oxidative stress,  HUVECs INTRODUCTION Pesticides  are  commonly  used  compounds  in  farming  that  have a wide range of classes, such as insecticides, herbicides,  fungicides, nematicides, acaricides, rodenticides, avicides, wood  preservatives, and antifoulants. A remarkable amount of these  pesticides spreads into the environment and this brings about  immunotoxicity,  carcinogenesis,  and  endocrine  and  develop- mental toxicity. Authorities such EFSA, EPA, and the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, attaches importance to assessing pesticide  compound mixture effects on the environment and living or- ganisms (Laetz, Baldwin & Collier., 2009; Oyesola, Iranloye & Ad- egoke, 2019). Risk assessment of pesticide mixture is a highly  important  issue  due  to  environmental  and  human  exposure.  People  are  always  exposed  to  pesticide  combinations  due  to  protective strategies against pests in farms in farming. However,  there is still no strict rule for risk assessment of pesticide com- pound mixture. Different combination risk assessment models Address for Correspondence:  Mehtap KARA, e-mail: mehtap.kara@istanbul.edu.tr This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

can be seen in the literature. The most common risk assessment  model is the dose addition model found in the European Food  Safety Authority (EFSA) guidelines (Staal et al., 2018). Conazole  fungicides  are  widely  used  for  agriculture  and  also  treatment of mycosis and candida infections in humans and ani- mals. Conazole fungicides cause disarrangement of fungal mem- branes  via  inhibition  of  cytochrome  P450  enzyme  lanosterol  14α-demethylase (CYP51). CYP51 is one of the main elements of  ergosterol biosynthesis and normal fungal membrane integrity.  Canozole fungicides have side effects such as endocrine disrup- tion. These compounds exert their endocrine disrupting effects  via CYP51 and CYP19 inhibition, which play a significant role as  steroidogenic enzymes (Roelofs, Temming, Piersma, van der Beg  & van Duursen, 2014). Tebuconazole is a widely used fungicide  that has a sterol demethylation inhibitor effect. It has been re- ported that the Tebuconazole plasma half-life is approximately  600 days, and it causes toxic effects on the thyroid, liver, nervous  system, and reproductive organs. In addition, it also exposes de- velopmental and genetic toxicity (Li et al., 2020). Chlormequat  chloride  is  a  quaternary  ammonium  compound  which is used for floriculture as a plant growth regulator by re- ducing longitudinal shoot growth effect (Vijitharan, Warnasekare,  Lokunarangoda, Farah & Siribaddana, 2016). Exposure to human  beings is quite common. According to WHO, chlormequat is ex- creted 98% invariably and its acceptable daily intake (ADI) level  is  0.05  mg/kg.bw.  It  is  totally  eliminated  from  the  body  within  46 h. It is important to investigate the potential toxic effects of  chlormequat on cellular mechanisms due to the wide range of  species that are exposed to it (Xiagedeer, Wu, Liu, & Hao, 2016).  Organophosphorus pesticides (OP) are the most common pesti- cide type used worldwide. OPs are absorbed via inhalation, skin,  eyes, and ingestion. The main acute toxic effect is inhibition of  the acetylcholinesterase enzyme, which results in a cholinergic  crisis. Pirimiphos-methyl belongs to the OP group of pesticides,  which  are  non-cumulative  and  broad  spectrum  compounds.  Even  though  pirimiphos-methyl  is  classified  as “no  reprotoxin,  no teratogen” by OECD, its harmful effects on development and  on the reproductive and immune systems have been shown in  studies (Oyesola et al. 2019; Olsvik, Berntssen & Søfteland, 2017;  Anogwih, 2014). Glyphosate is a non – selective organophospho- rus herbicide and it has bioaccumulation potential in the environ- ment. Glyphosate exposure causes toxic effects in mammalians  by increasing oxidative stress levels. Due to its common usage,  this pesticide residue can be found in food and environmental  samples. The main toxicity mechanism of glyphosate increases  the emergence of ROS and causes disruption on cellular mac- romolecules by ROS (Cai et al., 2020; Odetti et al., 2020; Zhang,  Yang, Ma, Shi & Chen, 2020). Chlorpyrifos is another widely used  broad-spectrum organophosphorus insecticide. It has been re- ported that chlorpyrifos might have some toxic effects on organs  and systems. Its common toxic effect is on the nervous system  by  acetylcholinesterase  (AChE)  inhibition.  Its  main  toxic  effect  mechanism is associated with cellular oxidative stress increment  (Deng, Zhang, Lu, Zhao & Ren, 2016; Dokuyucu, et al., 2016). Del- tamethrin  is  part  of  the  potent  pyrethroid  class  of  insecticides  and acaricides. Also, deltamethrin has been used for controlling  human  diseases  caused  by  mosquitos  that  are  vectors  of  Zika virus and Dengue virus. It has been reported that deltamethrin  exerts its toxic effects by increasing cellular ROS and reactive ni- trogen species (RNS). Oxidative stress remarkably increases the  deltamethrin toxicity mechanism (Lu et al., 2019). Oxidative  stress  is  a  cellular  imbalance  condition  which  is  formed between free radical production and the antioxidant  defense  system.  Several  chemicals  may  cause  free  radical  production and through this, these radicals interact with im- portant  cellular  molecules  and  impair  their  functions  patho- logically  (Abdollahi,  Ranjbar,  Shadnia,  Nikfar  &  Rezaie,  2004).  Pesticide exposure may cause reactive oxygen species produc- tion in the cell that exceeds antioxidant defenses system. The  cellular antioxidant system includes several molecules and en- zymes, including reduced glutathione (GSH), non-protein thi- ols,  catalase  (CAT),  glutathione-S-transferases  (GST),  superox- ide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione reductase (GR) (Ferreira,  et al., 2010). The pesticide-induced oxidative stress molecular  mechanism  has  still  not  been  clarified  and  is  under  scrutiny  by  scientists  seeking  to  evaluate  risk  factors  and  understand  related pathologic diseases (Agrawal & Sharma, 2010). There  are  limited  studies  in  the  literature  for  these  six  pesti- cides’  effects  on  cellular  oxidative  stress  in  endothelial  cells.  HUVECs are cell models that are frequently used to investigate  the underlying mechanisms of endothelial diseases (Medina- Leyte, Domínguez‐Pérez, Mercado, Villarreal‐Molina, & Jacobo‐ Albavera, 2020) In this study, we have evaluated the toxicity of  singly and mixture In this study, we have evaluated the toxicity  of  chlorpyrifos-methyl,  chlormequat,  deltamethrin,  glypho- sate, pirimiphos-methyl, tebuconazole singly and as a mixture.  Further  oxidative  stress-inducing  potential  was  evaluated  in  HUVECs. This  is  the  first  study  of  the  effects  of  this  pesticide  mixture on HUVECs. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture and cell viability assays The  Human  Umbilical Vein  Endothelial  (HUVEC)  cell  line  was  provided from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC® PCS- 100-010™). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (GIBCO, Uxbridge,  UK) including 10% fetal bovine serum (GIBCO, Uxbridge, UK),  100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (GIBCO, Ux- bridge, UK), with incubation conditions of 37°C and a humidi- fied  atmosphere  with  5%  CO2.  Cell  passage  was  performed  with  0.025%  trypsin-0.02%  EDTA  after  cell  co-fluency.  Cells  passage was performed twice a week. HUVEC cells are a suf- ficient  model  for  investigating  the  molecular  mechanisms  of  cardiovascular  diseases  under  different  chemical  exposure  conditions (Medina-Leyte et al., 2020). Chlormequat chloride, pirimiphos-pethyl, glyphosate, tebuco- nazole,  chlorpyrifos-methyl,  deltamethrin,  and  their  mixture’s  effects  on  the  HUVECs  viability  were  assessed  by  MTT  test,  which depends on measuring the reduction of 3-(4,5-dimeth- ylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium  bromide  (MTT)  com- pound  to  formazan  by  the  mitochondrial  enzyme  succinate  dehydrogenase. After a 24 h exposure duration, cells were in- cubated with MTT for 3 h at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere  (95%) with 5% CO2. After incubation, cell media was discarded, 100  µL  DMSO  was  added  into  each  well,  and  absorbance  of  formazan compound was measured with spectrophotometry  (Epoch, Biotek) at a wavelength of 595 nm. Pesticide exposure  concentrations are shown in Table 1 (Roelofs et al. 2014). Table 1. Pesticide exposure concentrations for cell  viability assay.

This assay was based  on quantifying LDH activity via reducing NAD to NADH, then  NADH interacts with a specific kit reagent that produces a col- or which can be detected at 450 nm. Cell lysates were mixed  with reaction reagent and the colored sample was read at nm with a spectrophotometer (Epoch, Biotek). Total Antioxidant Status (TAS): TAS assay was performed via a TAS  reagent kit (Rel Assay Diagnostics – Turkey) through the manu- facturer’s service bulletin. This assay was based on antioxidants  reducing  kit  ABST  component,  and  the  absorbance  change  was  detected  by  spectrophotometer  at  660  nm. The  assay  is  calibrated via trolox equivalent. Cell lysates and standards were  mixed with reagent 1 and this mixture was measured spectro- photometrically.  After  reagent  2  was  added  into  the  mixture,  the measurement was done at 5 min interval at 660 nm. Total Oxidant Status (TOS): TOS assay was performed by TOS a  Reagent  kit  (Rel  Assay  Diagnostics  – Turkey)  with  the  manu- facturer’s instruction. This assay was based on oxidants in the  sample  which  oxidize  the  ferrous  ions.  Oxidized  ferric  ions  make  a  colored  complex  that  can  be  measured  by  spectro- photometer  at  530  nm. The  assay  is  calibrated  via  hydrogen  peroxide. Cell lysates and standards were mixed with reagent and the first spectrophotometric measurement wasdone with  530 nm. Then reagent 2 was added into the mixture and ab- sorbance measurement was was done at 5 minutes interval. Total Glutathione (GSH) Assay: GSH assay was performed by Glu- tathione Detection Assay Kit (Fluorometric) (Abcam-ab65322).  This kit detects both reduced and oxidized glutathione. This as- say is based on monochlorobimane (MCB), which is adducted  with  GSH  that  is  catalyzed  by  GST.  Bound  MCB  creates  fluo- rescent blue light (Ex/Em=380/461 nm), which is detected by  fluorometer (CARY ECLIPSE - USA).

For LDH, TAS, TOS  and GSH assays 25, 50, 100 and 200 mM concentrations were  chosen for 24 h exposure. We used concentrations that were  above the IC50 values to compare higher concentration effects  on oxidative stress parameters. LDH assay LDH  values  significantly  decreased  at  25  mM  concentration  for  all  six  pesticides  compared  to  the  control  group.  Chlor- mequat chloride exposure to all experimental concentrations  decreased  LDH  level.  Increased  LDH  levels  were  observed  in  higher  concentrations  of  chlorpyrifos-methylp  and  pirimi- phos-methyl  groups.  50  and  200  mM  mix  groups  showed  a  significant  decrease  in  LDH  levels  compared  to  the  control  group (Figure 2).

DISCUSSION Pesticides  are  commonly  used  chemicals  that  protect  agri- cultural  products  from  weeds,  insects,  fungus,  and  rodents.  However,  pesticides  are  mostly  toxic  for  the  environment  and living organisms. Also, pesticides are commonly used for  controlling malaria and dengue disease vectors and control- ling plant growth in public places, such as parks and gardens,

Pesti- cide exposure has different acute and chronic effects, includ- ing  cancer,  asthma,  diabetes,  and  neurodegeneration  (Kim,  Kabir & Jahan, 2017). One of the main mechanisms underly- ing reasons of pesticide toxicity is oxidative stress. Pesticides  have  induced  oxidative  stress  mechanisms  in  relation  with  diseases, and this is still a question of debate. Oxidative stress  is  a  cellular  homeostatic  imbalance  between  ROS  and  anti- oxidants. While ROS increases in the cell, ROS products inter- act with important cellular molecules and cause detrimental  effects in the cell that bring about several different diseases.  Antioxidants are very important cellular soldiers against ROS  products. There are several different studies on the oxidative stress induction effects of pesticides in the literature (Agrawal  &Sharma, 2010). In our study, we have investigated the cytotoxicity and oxida- tive  stress  inducing  effects  of  six  different  pesticides  (chlor- pyrifos-methyl,  pirimiphos-methyl,  glyphosate,  chlormequat  chloride,  deltamethrin,  and  tebuconazole)  and  the  exposure  of the mixture of them on the HUVEC cell line. HUVECs are very  important for analyzing endothelial markers and representing  vascular physiology in vitro. It is a general model for endothe- lial cells with normal and pathological condition analyses. The  HUVEC cell line is a good choice for analyzing xenobiotic toxic  effects (Cao et al. 2017; Benachour & Séralini, 2009). It has been reported that LDH levels increase during oxidative  stress induction in the cells (Jovanovic et al., 2010). According  to our results, LDH levels decrease in a lower concentration ( mM) in all pesticide groups. LDH levels significantly decrease in  all chlormequat chloride concentrations. Increased LDH levels  are observed in a higher concentration of chlorpyrifos-methyl  and  pirimiphos-methyl  groups.  The  increased  LDH  level  of  higher concentrations is associated with why these concentra- tions have exceeded IC50 values. Decreased LDH levels are ob- served significantly in 50 and 200 mM mix groups compared  to the control group. In this study, TAS levels decrease and TOS  levels increase in all groups, and this is balanced in itself. This is  the first study to demonstrate chlormequat cloride effects on  LDH levels and oxidative stress. It has been demonstrated that  chlorpyrifos-methyl,  pirimiphos-methyl,  glyphosate,  chlor- mequat  chloride,  deltamethrin,  and  tebuconazole  increased  LDH  and  oxidative  stress  levels  in  different  studies  (Banaee  et al. 2019; Hatami, Banaee, Nematdoodt, & Haghi 2019; Nasr,  El-Demerdash  &  El-Nagar,  2016; Yıldırım  et  al.  2013;  Sai  et  al.  2014; Tilak, Veeraiah & Rao, 2005; Mansour & Mossa, 2011; Piatti,  Marabini & Chiesara, 1994; Martínez et al 2020; Li et al. 2017;  Gholami-Seyedkolaei,  Mirvaghefi,  Farahmand,  &  Kosari  2013;  Gündüz et al. 2015; Abdel-Daim et al. 2016; Ncir et al. 2016; Ber- rouague et al. 2019; Ben Othmène et al.2020), and our result is  in accordance with previous studies. In our study, GSH levels significantly decreased concentration  dependent for all exposure concentrations in the chlormequat  chloride, deltamethrin, tebuconazole, and mixture groups. In  the glyphosate group of 50, 100 and 200 mM concentrations,  GSH  levels  decreased  significantly  compared  to  the  control  group. In pirimiphos-methyl 100 and 200 mM concentrations,  GSH  levels  decreased  significantly  compared  to  the  control  group.  For  chlorpyrifos-methyl  group  100  and  200  mM  con- centrations,  GSH  levels  decreased  significantly  compared  to  the control group. This is the first study showing chlormequat  chloride and Tebuconazole’s effects on GSH level. This study is  done in accordance with previous studies on decreasing GSH  in  the  literature  for  deltamethrin  (Zaki,  Algaleel,  Imam,  Soli- man & Ghoneim, 2020; Bhattacharjee, Borah & Das, 2020; Ku- mar, Sharma, Rana & Sharma, 2019; Yang et al. 2020; Ndonwi  et al. 2019; Wang, Shen, Zhou, & Jin 2019; Velki &Hackenberger,  2013). In  conclusion,  living  organisms  always  encounter  different  types of pesticides and their combination in daily life through  different  exposure  pathways.  It  is  very  important  to  clarify  their  toxic  effect  mechanisms  and  relations  with  diseases  to  make  effective  risk  assessments  and  set  regulations  based  on this information. Endothelial cells situate in the first phase  of  exposure  to  xenobiotics,  and  they  are  affected  more. This  study  has  confirmed  that  the  oxidative  stress  inducing  ef- fects  of  exposure  to  different  types  of  pesticides  and  their  mixture  (chlorpyrifos-methyl,  pirimiphos-methyl,  glyphosate,  chlormequat  chloride,  deltamethrin,  tand  tebuconazole)  and  reducing antioxidant capacity of the cells. Further in vitro and  in vivo studies need to clarify molecular interactions between  pesticide inducing oxidative stress and endothelial cell related  diseases. When these mechanisms are understood, protective and therapeutic strategies for the treatment of pesticide expo- sure’s toxic effects can be developed. Peer-review: Externally peer-reviewed.
