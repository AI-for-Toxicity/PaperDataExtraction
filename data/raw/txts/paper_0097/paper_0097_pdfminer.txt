This  raises  the  possibility of  antagonistic,  additive,  or  synergistic  neurotoxicity  in  exposed  organisms.  Acetylcholinesterase  (AChE) inhibition  has  been  demonstrated  to  be  useful  as  a  biomarker  for  exposure  to  OP  and  CBs  in  many environments.  This  study  investigated  the  response  of  houseﬂy  (Musca  domestica)  head  AChE  (HF-AChE) ﬁve  OPs;  chlorpyrifos  (CPF),  malathion  (MLT),  triazophos  (TRZ),  monocrotophos  (MCP)  and exposed  to  profenofos  (PRF)  and  two  CBs;  carbaryl  (CRB)  and  carbofuran  (CBF)  as  individual  compounds  and  as binary  mixtures  of  OPs  and  CBs  under  in  vitro  conditions.  In  addition,  the  selected  OPs  and  CBs  were evaluated  for  their  toxicity  in  binary  combinations  with  two  SPs;  deltamethrin  (DLT)  and  cypermethrin ﬁve  OPs  with  two  CBs (CYP)  at  pesticides  was  evaluated  under  oxidised  and  un-oxidised  conditions  using  a  toxic  unit  (TU)  approach  and a  concentration  addition  (CA)  model.  Pyrethroid  combinations  were  assessed  only  under  oxidised conditions.  Since  OPs  and  CBs  act  by  a  similar  mechanism  of  inhibition  of  AChE,  a  dose  additive  effect  was expected,  but  not  conclusively  found.  TRZ  with  either  CBF  or  CRB  exhibited  synergism  under  oxidised  and un-oxidised  conditions  but  the  degree  of  synergism  was  stronger  under  un-oxidised  conditions. Additivity  was  exhibited  by  CBF  +  MCP,  CRB  +  MCP,  CRB  +  MLT  and  CBF  +  MCP  under  un-oxidised conditions  and  CRB  +  MCP  and  CRB  +  CPF  under  oxidised  conditions.  Pyrethorids  in  combination  with  OPs (TRZ,  MLT  and  CPF)  were  highly  synergistic.  In  the  present  study,  we  used  pure  houseﬂy  head  AChE without  any  interference  of  monooxygenase  and/or  esterase  enzyme  activities.  Therefore  these  other enzymes  were  not  producing  the  observed  deviations  from  concentration-addition  in  the  binary combinations  between  OPs,  CBs  and  SPs.  The  mechanisms  of  OP,  CB  and  SP  interactions  in  pesticide mixtures  requires  further  investigation. mg/L.

1.  Introduction In  India,  the  total  consumption  of  pesticides  during  2009– was  52,408  metric  tons  (MT).  This  included  usage  of  46,139  MT  of indigenous  pesticides  and  6269  MT  of  imported  pesticides  (Zonal Conference,  2013).  Based  on  2009–10  survey,  among  these pesticides,  usage  of  organophosphorus  pesticides  (OPs)  in  India varied  from  1164  to  1815  MT.  Cypermethrin  usage  was  the  highest (2473  MT)  whereas  deltamethrin  usage  was  the  lowest  (94  MT).  In 2011–2012,  pesticide  usage  in  India  increased  to  52,979  MT. Among  carbamates  (CBs),  carbofuran  usage  is  higher  than  carbaryl, but  both  these  insecticides  are  being  imported. Recently,  OP-pyrethroid  combinations  such  as  cypermethrin- ethion,  deltamethrin-triazophos,  and  deltamethrin-chlorpyrifos have  been  introduced  to  overcome  emerging  pyrethroid  resistance in  agricultural  pests  (Martin  et  al.,  2003).  Fixed  dose  combinations such  as  50%  of  chlorpyrifos  and  5%  cypermethrin  manufactured  in China,  50%  profenofos  and  4%  cypermethrin,  1%  delatamethrin  in combination  with  35%  EC  triazophos  and  several  other  illegall pesticide  mixtures  are  sold  India  (Tripathi  et  al.,  2006). in  Pyrethroids  and  OPs  are  extensively  used  for  vector-borne  disease control  and  are  particularly  important  to  check  the  outbreak  of malaria.  Pesticides  can  adversely  affect  vegetables,  fruits,  animal resources  and  human  health  (Amaraneni  and  Pillala  2001;  Kumari et  al.,  2003;  Mandal  and  Singh,  2010;  Gowda  and  Somashekar 2012;  Lari  et  al.,  2014).  Residues  of  OPs,  CBs  and  synthetic pyrethroids  were  detected  in  measurable  amounts  during  1997– 1998  market  sampling  survey  of  winter  vegetables  in  Haryana, India  (Kumari  et  al.,  2003).  According  to  this  study,  approximately 32%  of  the  vegetable  samples  were  contaminated  with  OPs  and  CBs above  their  respective  maximum  residue  limit  (MRL)  values.  An  OP pesticide,  chlorpyrifos  (CPF)  was  detected  in  surface  waters  in Bhandara  and  Amravati  regions  of  India  at  a  concentrations  up  to mg/L  (Lari  et  al.,  2014).  Residues  of  CPF  have  been  also  found  in 0. mg/kg  (Amaraneni  and  Pillala,  2001). ﬁsh  in  Kolleru  Lake  at  88, Traditionally,  the  evaluation  of  the  quality  of  the  aquatic environment  has  been  undertaken  at  the  chemical  level,  identify- ing  and  quantifying  chemical  residues  in  the  different  compart- ments  of  the  ecosystem.  However,  to  make  an  accurate  assessment of  the  environmental  risk,  the  quantiﬁcation  of  chemical  residues should  be  complemented  with  the  investigation  of  biomarkers  that serve  as  early  warning  signals  (Domingues  et  al.,  2010). Acetylcholinesterase  (AChE)  is  an  enzyme  that  has  been  widely used  as  a  sensitive  biomarker  of  exposure  to  OP  and  CB  pesticides (Kumar  and  Chapman  2001;  Walker  et  al.,  2001;  Laetz  et  al.,  2009, 2013;  Arora  and  Kumar,  2015). The  OPs  and  CBs  inhibits  AChE  which,  in  turn,  hydrolyses acetylcholine.  Acetylcholine  is  a  neurotransmitter  at  cholinergic nerve  synapses.  These  include  the  postganglionic  parasympathetic and  cholinergic  sympathetic  nerves,  and  both  sympathetic  and ﬁbres.  Binding  of  OP  with  AChE parasympathetic  preganglionic  leads  to  phosphorylation  of  the  enzyme  and  this  reaction  is  not easily  reversible  (Matsumura,  1985;  Fukuto,  1990;  Erdman,  2004). The  rate  of  spontaneous  reactivation  of  AChE  is  very  slow  with diethyl  OPs  while  it  is  relatively  fast  with  dimethyl  OPs.  Further, there  is  ageing  of  the  phosphorylated  enzyme  after  which  the enzyme  cannot  be  reactivated  by  oximes.  The  replacement  of  an oxygen  atom  in  the  organophosphorus  structure  by  sulfur  leads  to the  formation  of  organothiophosphorus  compounds  such  as chlorpyrifos,  malathion  and  parathion,  which  have  a  lower  lethal potential.  However,  in  vivo  metabolisation  to  the  oxon  metabolite enhances  their  toxicity  (Erdman,  2004).  There  is  a  clear  measur- able  potential  for  mixtures  of  OPs  and  carbamates  in  agricultural ﬁsh  (Gruber  and waters  to  cause  AChE  inhibition  in  Munn,  1998;  Kumar  and  Chapman,  2001).  Cypermethrin,  a synthetic  (Type  II)  pyrethroid  acts  on  voltage-gated  sodium  and ﬁeld-exposed for  ester  hydrolysis chloride  channels  in  contrast  to  Type  I  pyrethroids  that  predomi- nantly  delay  the  closure  of  sodium  channels.  Pyrethroids  are times  more  toxic  to  insects  than  humans  (Bradberry  et  al.,  2005). The  mammalian  resistance  to  pyrethroid  toxicity  is  due  to  their leading  to  rapid  detoxiﬁcation. capacity  Carboxylesterase  inhibitors  such  as  OPs  may  enhance  the  toxicity of  pyrethroid  by  inhibiting  detoxiﬁcation  (Hernandez  et  al.,  2013). Although  OPs  share  a  common  mechanism  of  action,  assessing cumulative  risk  from  exposures  to  OP  mixtures  remains  a challenge  (Mileson  et  al.,  1998).  In  parallel  to  human  health,  OP mixture  toxicity  remains  an  important  consideration  for  the conservation  of  non-target,  non-mammalian  species.  Assessing  the effects  of  mixtures  of  contaminants  is  an  issue  of  high  priority  by many  governmental  agencies  around  the  world  (Eggen  et  al.,  2004; Lydy  et  al.,  2004;  Woods  et  al.,  2002;  Schloz  and  Hopkins,  2006; Phyu  et  al.,  2011;  Laetz  et  al.,  2013).  As  the  potential  for  multiple chemical  exposure  increases,  the  question  raised  is  whether  the toxicity  of  mixtures  of  chemicals  is  simply  additive  or  whether there  is  potentiation  of  toxicity.  The  general  consensus  has  been that  chemicals  interact  by  concentration  addition.  However  past studies  have  demonstrated  that  concentration  addition  of  the components  of  a  mixture  does  not  always  reﬂect  the  overall interaction  of  a  mixture.  The  combinations  of  toxicants  that  have enhanced  toxicity  are  of  greatest  concern  because  the  toxicity predicted  from  the  individual  components  would  under  estimate the  overall  toxicity.  Consequently  combined  effects  of  mixtures have  to  be  considered  in  ecological  and  human  health  risk assessment.  In  the  case  of  pesticides,  the  difﬁculty  is  due  in  part  to their  large  numbers  that  enter  aquatic  systems  via  various  fate  and transport  pathways  (Barbash,  2003;  Schulz,  2004). In  this  study,  the (cid:3)puriﬁed  AChE  enzyme  from  the  houseﬂy ﬁve head  was  used  as  an  in  vitro  model  (i)  to  assess  the  toxicity  of  organophosphorous  pesticides:  chlorpyrifos  (CPF),  profenofos (PRF),  malathion  (MLT),  monocrotophos  (MCP),  triazophos  (TRZ) in  binary  combinations  with  carbaryl  (CRB)  and  carbofuran  (CBF) under  oxidised  and  un-oxidised  conditions  (ii)  to  assess  the ﬁve  OPs  and  two  CBs  with  the  synthetic  pyrethroids: toxicity  of  ﬁxed  concentration cypermethrin  (CYP)  and  deltamethrin  (DLT)  at  in  binary  combinations  under  oxidised  conditions. 2.  Materials  and  methods 2.1.  Chemicals  and  reagents iodide Acetylcholinesterase  from  the  houseﬂy  (Musca  domestica)  was purchased  from  TARI  (Taiwan  Agricultural  Research  Institute).  All solvents  used  for  stock  solutions  were  analytical  grade.  Acetylth- (ATCh),  50,50-Dithio-bis(2-Nitrobenzoic  Acid) iocholine  (DTNB),  p-Nitrophenyl  acetate,  carbaryl  (99.8%  purity),  chlorpyri- fos  (99.5%  purity),  profenofos  (98.4%  purity),  malathion  and carbofuran  (99.0%  purity),  monocrotophos,  cypermethrin  and deltamethrin  (99.8%  purity)  were  purchased  from  Sigma-Aldrich Pvt.  Ltd. Pesticide  stock  solutions  were  prepared  in  acetone  (4–5  g/L) (cid:3)18 (cid:4)C.  Working  stock  solutions  were  prepared and  stored  at  freshly  in  50%  methanol.  The  measured  concentrations  of pesticides  ranged  between  95  and  110%  of  their  nominal  values, The  concentration  range  for  different  OPs  used  in  the  in  vitro mg/L);  MCP  (0.1– follows:  CPF  (0.003–3. bioassays  were  as  mg/L)  and  MLT  (0.2– mg/L);  PRF  (7–

mg/L);  TAZ  (1– mg/L). 2.2.  Enzyme  purity  and  speciﬁcity The in  25  mM potassium  phosphate  (pH  7.2)  buffer.  The  dissolved  protein  was lyophilised  protein  sample  was  dissolved S.  Arora  et  al.  /  Toxicology  Letters  268  (2017)  8– analysed  by  polyacrylamide  gel  electrophoresis  (PAGE)  under native  conditions.  Native  PAGE  (polyacrylamide  gel  electrophore- sis)  was  performed  as  described  (Schägger  and  Jagow,  1991)  with the  following  modiﬁcations.  Native  PAGE  was  performed  at  23 (cid:4)C using  3–12%  polyacrylamide  gradient  gel  for  100  min  at  150  V (Native  PAGETM,  ThermoFisher  scientiﬁc,  USA)  as  per  manufac- turer’s  instructions.  The  samples  were  prepared  in  a  NativePAGETM mg  of  protein  was  loaded.  After  electro- Sample  Buffer  and  18. phoresis  the  gel  was  stained  for  the  esterase  activity  as  described (Ono  et  al.,  1994).  Brieﬂy,  the  gel  was  placed  into  a  solution containing  a  mixture  of  Fast  Blue  B  dye  (Sigma  Aldrich,  USA)  and a-naphthyl  acetate  solution  for  10  min  and  photographed. increase The  substrate  speciﬁcity  of  the  enzyme  against  choline  esters and  carboxyl  esters  was  determined  by  following  methods.  The speciﬁc  activity  of  the  enzyme  with  ATCh  was  measured  at  pH  7. in  50  mM  phosphate  buffer  by  monitoring  the  in absorbance  within  the  linear  range  at  412  nm.  The  increase  in absorbance  results  from  the  generation  of  2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate dianion  (TNB2(cid:3))  from  DTNB  after  its  reaction  with  thiocholine.  The concentration  of  TNB2(cid:3) was  calculated  by  using  its  molar extinction  coefﬁcient,  which  is  reported  to  be  14150  M(cid:3)1cm(cid:3) elsewhere  (Riddles  et  al.,  1979).  The  carboxylesterase  activity  of this  enzyme  against  p-nitrophenyl  acetate  was  measured  in  above mentioned  buffer  by  monitoring  the  increase  in  absorbance  due  to production  of  p-nitrophenol.  As  the  pH  of  the  reaction  mixture  was not  very  favourable  for  the  full  deprotonation  of  p-nitrophenol,  the increase  in  absorbance  was  monitored  within  the  linear  range  at  its isosbestic  point  which  is  reported  to  be  348  nm  (Hotta  et  al.,  2002). 2.3.  In-vitro  enzyme  assay ( test  solutions The  in  vitro  inhibition  of  AChE  was  evaluated  using  houseﬂy- head  puriﬁed  AChE  enzyme  using  a  modiﬁed  version  of  the method  described  by  Ellman  et  al.  (1961)  and  validated  by  Arora mL)  at  various and  Kumar,  2015.  Brieﬂy,  concentrations  of  each  pesticide  and  their  binary  mixtures  were added  to  each  microplate  well  followed  by  the  addition  of  AChE enzyme  solution.  Preliminary  experiments  were  conducted  to establish  the  optimal  incubation  time  for  the  enzyme  reaction. Reaction  for  10  min  was  observed  to  be  optimal  incubation  time where  linear  reaction  was  observed  for  OPs  and  CBs,  under  the present  study.  The  mixture  was  incubated  at  room  temperature  for ten  minutes  and  then  the  residual  AChE  activity  was  determined with  the  microplate  reader  (Titerteks  Multiskan  MC  Photometer) at  405  nm  for  10  min  following  addition  of  mixture  of  DTNB  and ﬁnal  concentrations  of  AChE,  ATCh ATCh  solutions  ( mL/mL,  1.5  and  0.22  mM,  respectively.  The and  DTNB  were  0. ﬁnal  well  concentration  of  methanol  was  <0.01%.  The  kinetics  of the  10  min  measuring  phase  was  determined  (DA/T).  The  results were  corrected  for  the  solvents  and  the  reaction  mixture  with DTNB  and  ATCh. mL).  The All  assays  were  conducted  with  three  replicates  and  the  data from  three  independent  trials  were  pooled  (nine  wells  were averaged  for  each  pesticide;  n  =  9)  to  calculate  the  median  AChE inhibitory  concentration  (EC50)  based  on  nominal  aqueous concentrations.  A  spreadsheet  developed  by  Barnes  et  al.  (2003) and  validated  for  AChE  investigations  (Kumar  et  al.,  2010)  was  used for  estimating  the  concentrations  that  caused  a  20  and  50%  effect (EC20,  and  EC50,  respectively)  and  their  95%  conﬁdence  intervals. This  spread  sheet  is  based  on  the  Logit  model. 2.4.  Enzyme  analyses  before  and  after  oxidation It  has  been  shown  that  OPs  containing  a  thione  group,  such  as malathion,  chlorpyrifos,  triazophos,  are  converted  into  oxon derivatives  by  oxidation  with  diluted  bromine  water  (0.4%).  These (cid:5) oxon  derivatives  are  more  potent  ChE  inhibitors.  Diluted  bromine water  (5%)  was  used  for  oxidation  of  OP  pesticides  as  described ﬁnal  well  concentration  for earlier  by  Arora  and  Kumar  (2015).  The  bromine  water  was  3. inhibition  for individual  and  binary  mixtures  of  the  pesticides  was  assessed before  and  after  oxidation  with  bromine  water.  Negative  control/ blank  reactions  were  also  run  with  AChE  and  only  Br  water.  No effect  was  observed  in  the  absence  of  pesticide  in  the  reaction mixture.  We  did  not  measure  any  other  metabolite  produced  after the  reaction  with  bromine  water. 10(cid:3)6%.  The  enzyme 2.5.  Binary  combinations  of  pesticide  mixtures-  experimental  design fractions  of  their individual  EC50 values The  concentrations  used  in  the  mixture  toxicity  tests  were based  on  EC50 values  derived  from  tests  conducted  with  individual pesticides.  The  pesticides  were  added  in  equitoxic  concentrations (identical  for  each pesticide).  Six  concentrations  below  the  EC50 value  (1/64  EC50, 1/4 EC50 and 1/2 EC50),  one  at  the  EC 1/32  EC50,  1/16  EC50,  1/8  EC50, value  and  three  concentrations  above  the  EC50 value  (2,  4  and  8  x EC50)  were  established  using  serial  dilutions.  Binary  mixtures  of the  pesticides  were  used  for  toxicity  tests.  The  nominal  amounts  of pesticides  were  pipetted  into  the  96-well  plate.  All  mixture  assays were  conducted  in  three  independent  triplicate  trials. For  binary  combinations,  EC  values  were  expressed  on  the  basis of  individual  components  in  the  mixture.  For  example,  in  binary combinations  CBF  +  CPF,  CBF-Mix  represents  toxicity  of  CBF  to inhibit  AChE  as  (EC10,  EC20 and  EC50)  in  the  presence  of  CPF. Similarly,  CPF-Mix  represents  toxicity  of  CPF  to  inhibit  AChE  in  the presence  of  CBF. For  binary  combinations  of  SPs  with  OPs  and  CBs,  the mg/L pyrethroids  concentration  was  kept  constant  at  0.1  and and  dose  response  curves  were  evaluated  for  EC50  and  EC values. 2.6.  Approaches  used  for  assessing  mixture  toxicity 2.6.1.  Toxic  unit  approach The  toxic  unit  (TU)  model  has  been  used  extensively  to determine  the  overall  toxicity  of  a  mixture  (Spehar  and  Fiandt 1986;  Forget  et  al.,  1999;  Woods  et  al.,  2002).  The  TU  is  the  sum  of the  toxic  contributions  of  each  component  in  the  mixture.  The  TU for  a  binary  mixture  is  given  by  the  following  equation: TU ¼ ECx  A  ECx  A ðmixÞ ðaloneÞ þ ECx  B  ECx  B ðmixÞ ðaloneÞ where  A  and  B  are  chemicals,  ECx  (mix)  is  the  effect  of  each component  in  the  binary  mix  and  ECx  (alone)  is  the  EC50 or  EC20 of A  and  B  applied  as  single  components.  By  this  model,  if  TU  equals one,  the  toxicity  of  the  mixture  is  additive.  If  TU  is  greater  than  one, the  toxicity  is  less  than  additive  (antagonistic)  and  if  the  TU  is  less than  one,  the  toxicity  of  the  mixture  is  more  than  additive (synergistic)  (Spehar  and  Fiandt,  1986). For  pyrethorid  combinations,  the  mixture  toxicity  was  evaluat- ed  by  using  similar  TU  approach  where  ECx (mix)  and  ECx alone  for OPs  and  CBs  were  compared  at  a  given  pyrethroids  concentration. 2.6.2.  Concentration  addition  model The  two  most  widely  used  conceptual  models  for  predicting mixture  toxicity  are  concentration  addition  (CA),  introduced  by ﬁrst Loewe  and  Muischnek  (1926),  and  independent  action  (IA),  described  by  Bliss  (1939). For  this  study,  we  applied  the  CA  equation  (equation  1)  as implemented  by  Altenburger  et  al.  (2004)  to  examine  whether  the concentration-response  relationships  of  binary  combinations

S.  Arora  et  al.  /  Toxicology  Letters  268  (2017)  8–

could  be  predicted  based  on  the  range  of  effects  observed  in response  to  single  compounds. ECxmix =  (Si  =  1  to  n(pi/ECxi))(cid:3) (1) ECxmix is  the  concentration  of  the  mixture  resulting  in  an  effect of  x%  relative  to  control,  ECxi is  the  concentration  of  component  i resulting  in  an  effect  of  x%  when  applied  in  isolation,  and  pi is  the proportion  of  the  total  concentration  of  the  mixture  (in  molar terms)  represented  by  component  i.  Whether  the  toxicity  of  each mixture  conformed  to  CA  was  determined  using  a  two-step process.  First,  if  the  observed  mixture  toxicity  value  fell  within  the 95%  conﬁdence  intervals  of  the  expected  value  of  a  model  then  the mixture  was  considered  to  have  conformed  to  the  model.  If, however,  an  observed  mixture  toxicity  value  was  outside  the  95% conﬁdence  intervals  of  the  expected  value  then  the  mixture potentially  may  not  conform  to  that  model. To  enable  a  quantitative  estimation  of  the  difference  in predicted  and  measured  toxicities,  the  model  deviation  ratio (MDR)  method  (Belden  et  al.,  2007)  was  used.  For  the  CA  model, the  MDR  was  derived  by  dividing  the  predicted  toxicity  value (EC20)  by  the  observed  toxicity  value.  The  MDR  values  greater  than 1.3  mean  that  the  toxicity  of  the  mixture  conforms  with  synergism while  values  less  than  0.7  are  taken  to  conform  to  antagonism (Belden  et  al.,  2007)  The  MDR  approach  has  been  successfully applied  by  other  researchers  (Phyu  et  al.,  2011;  Arora  and  Kumar, 2015). 3.

The speciﬁc  activity  for  this  enzyme  against  ATCh  and  p-nitrophenyl acetate  was  measured  to  be   0.05  nmoles min(cid:3)1 mg(cid:3)1 respectively.  This  several  log  folds  difference  in  the 322  and  1. (cid:6) (cid:6) speciﬁc  activities  for  two  different  types  of  esters  suggests  that  the enzyme  is  AChE. 3.2.  AChE  inhibition  of  single  pesticides  under  oxidised  and  un- oxidised  conditions Among  the  two  CBs  selected  in  this  study,  CBF  was  12  times  more toxic  than  CRB  (Table  2).  In  addition,  individual  CRB  and  CBF  EC values  did  not  vary  signiﬁcantly  under  un-oxidised  and  oxidised conditions  (Tables  1  and  2).  With  oxidation,  the  sensitivity  of  HF- AChE  to  CPF,  TRF  and  MLT  increased  signiﬁcantly  as  reported  earlier (Arora  and  Kumar,  2015)  (Table  2).  In  contrast,  the  two  OPs  (MCP  and PRF),  did  not  exhibit  any  signiﬁcant  differences  in  toxicity  under oxidised  and  un-oxidised  conditions  (Tables  1  and  2). 3.3.  Binary  mixture  combinations  under  un-oxidised  and  oxidised conditions Eight  possible  binary  combinations  of  four  selected  OPs  and CBs  (CBF  +  CPF,  CBF  +  MCP,  CBF  +  PRF,  CBF  +  TRZ,  CRB  +  CPF,  CRB  + MCP,  CRB  +  PRF,  CRB  +  TRZ)  were  assessed  for  their  toxicity  under oxidised  and  un-oxidised  conditions  using  HF-AChE  during  in  vitro exposures  (Tables  1  and  2).  Under  un-oxidised  conditions,  CBF  + mg/L  EC50 for  CPF- CPF  was  the  most  toxic  combination  with  58. mg/L  for  CRB  +  CPF mix  in  comparison  to  CPF-mix  EC50 value  of (Table  1).  The  CRB  and  CBF  in  combination  with  CPF  exhibited lower  EC50 values  in  comparison  to  the  individual  CPF  EC50 value  of mg/L  (Table  1).  Under  un-oxidised  conditions,  the  EC50 value  of TRZ  in  binary  combination  with  CBF  and  CRB  was  reduced  by folds  and  45  folds,  respectively  (Table  1).  In  contrast,  TRZ  toxicity under  oxidised  conditions  was  signiﬁcantly  reduced  (from  3.7–4. folds)  in  binary  combination  with  CBF  and  CRB  (Table  2). 3.4.  Mixture  toxicity  assessment The toxicological interactions  of ten  OP  and  CB  binary combinations  were  evaluated  using  the  toxic  unit  approach  (TU, Table  3)  and  the  concentration  addition  model  (CA,  Table  4).  In  the present  study,  we  used  pure  AChE  enzyme  resulting  in  the  absence of  Phase  I  biotransformation  enzymes  in  the  in  vitro  bioassays.  We used  bromine  water  to  create  oxidised  conditions,  which  mimics the  action  of  these  enzymes. Based  on  TU  and  CA  models,  TRZ  with  CBF  and  CRB  exhibited synergism  under  oxidised  and  un-oxidised  conditions  but  the degree  of  synergism  was  stronger  under  un-oxidised  conditions (Tables  3  and  4).  The  CRB  +PRF  combination  exhibited  antagonism under  oxidised  and  un-oxidised  conditions  (Tables  3  and  4).  In contrast,  the  CA  model  demonstrated  synergism  for  CRB  +  MCP  and CBF  +  MCP  under  un-oxidised  conditions  and  nearly  additive  under oxidised  conditions  (Table  4). Under  un-oxidised  conditions,  the  TU  approach  demonstrated CBF  +  PRF  combination  to  be  antagonistic  whereas  synergism  was established  using  CA  model  (Table  3).  In  contrast,  both  CA  and  TU models  exhibited  synergism  for  CBF  +  PRF  under  oxidised  con- ditions.  The  TU  model  conﬁrmed  additive  responses  for  CBF  +  CPF, CBF  +  MCP,  CRB  +  MCP  and  CRB  +  MLT  under  un-oxidised  conditions (Table  4)  and  CRB  +  MCP  and  CRB  +  CPF  under  oxidised  conditions (Table  3). In  the  current  study,  we  also  evaluated  HF-AChE  inhibition  for four  OPs  (MLT,  MCP,  CPF  and  TRZ)  and  one  CB  (CRB)  in  binary combination  with  two  SPs  (DLT  and  CYP).  In  the  presence  of  DLT mg/L,  the  MLT  toxicity and  CYP  at  was  increased  72–77  fold  and  TRZ  toxicity  was  increased  from  6  to 12  fold  while  CPF  and  CRB  was  increased  up  to  two  fold  only (Table  5).  The  TU  model  conﬁrmed  strong  synergism  for  CPF,  TRZ and  MLT  in  the  presence  of  DLT  or  CYP  (Table  6). ﬁxed  concentration  of  0.1  and Fig.  1.

Discussion The  primary  mode  of  toxicity  for  OPs  and  CBs  is  inhibition  of cholinesterase  activity.  Inhibition  of  AChE  activity  results  in  the build  up  of  acetylcholine  (ACh)  at  cholinergic  nerve  endings causing  continual  nerve  stimulation  (Scholz  and  Hopkins,  2006). CPF,  MLT  and  TRZ  represent  examples  of  the  phosphorothioate class  of  OP  insecticides.  Oxidative  desulfurization  by  Phase  I biotransformation  enzymes  replaces  the  sulfur  atom  with  an oxygen  atom,  resulting  in  an  O-analog  metabolite  that  is  a  more effective  AChE  inhibitor  than  the  parent  OP  (Fukuto,  1990). Generally,  the  oxon  analogues  are  more  potent  AChE  inhibitors than  the  parent  compound  (Kralj  et  al.,  2006).  In  the  present  study, carbamate  toxicity  was  similar  under  oxidised  and  un-oxidised conditions  which  is  in  conﬁrmation  with  the  fact  that  these pesticides  do  not  require  biotransformation  to  an  oxon  form  in order  to  inhibit  AChE  enzymes. investigated  under In  the  present  study,  HF-AChE  inhibition  exposed  to ﬁve  OPs  in binary  mixtures  with  CBs  was  in  vitro conditions.  To  examine  the  effects  of  oxidation  on  OP  potency  in the  HF-AChE  system,  bromine  water  was  used  as  an  oxidising agent.  HF-AChE  inhibition  for  CRB  and  CBF  was  similar  under oxidised  and  un-oxidised  conditions.  Individual  OPs  and  CBs  under un-oxidised  conditions  exhibited  sensitiviy  to  AChE  inhibition  in the  following  order: CBF  >  CPF  >  CRB  >  PRF  >  MCP  >  MLT  >  TRZ Under  oxidised  conditions,  CPF  was  observed  to  be  the  most potent  pesticide  and  HF-AChE  inhbition  was  in  the  following  order: CPF  >  TRZ  >  CBF  >  MLT  >  CRB  >  PRF>  MCP The  CA  model  has  recently  been  suggested  as  a  conservative default  assessment  tool  for  aquatic  mixtures  (not  just  pesticides), irrespective  of  modes  or  mechanisms  of  action  (Kortenkamp  et  al., 2009).  Based  on  the  fact  that  OPs  and  CBs  act  by  a  similar mechanism  of  inhibition  of  AChE,  one  would  expect  that  the behaviour  of  a  mixture  would  be  a  simple  dose-additive  effect (Deneer,  2000;  Kudsk  et  al.,  2005;  Belden  et  al.,  2007).  In  the present  study,  OP+  CB  binary  combinations  were  mainly  synergis- tic  under  oxidised  conditions.  Although  OPs  and  CBs  have  the  same mode  of  action,  the  principal  difference  between  OP-and  carba- mate-induced  inhibitory  action  is  in  the  stability  of  the  AChE-OP/ carbamate  complex.  Carbamates  are  considered  reversible  AChE inhibitors  and  OPs  as  irreversible  AChE  inhibitors.  OPs  are  able  to phosphorylate  serine  residues  of  AChE  in  non-reversible  way, whereas  the  carbamylated  serine  residue  is  less  stable  and  the carbamyl  moiety  can  be  split  from  the  enzyme  by  spontaneous hydrolysis  (Kuhr  and  Dorough,  1976;  Darvesh  et  al.,  2008). We  have  earlier  reported  antagonistic  effects  of  the  binary combination  of  OPs  (CPF  +  PRF,  CPF  +  MLT,  MCP  +  MLT,  PRF  +  MLT, MLT  +  TRZ  and  PRF  +  TRZ)  under  oxidised  conditions  (Arora  and Kumar,  2015).  This  was  explained  on  the  basis  of  dispositional  and/ or  receptor  antagonism.  We  also  reported  synergistic  responses  for the  majority  of  the  OP  binary  combinations  assayed  under  un- oxidised  conditions  (Arora  and  Kumar,  2015).  Triazophos  showed very  strong  synergism  in  binary  combinations  with  CPF,  MCP  and PRF  under  un-oxidised  conditions.  In  the  present  study,  TRZ showed  synergistic  effects  with  CBF  and  CRB.  Laetz  et  al.  (2009) observed  both  concentration  additivity  and  synergism  in  the binary  combinations  of  carbamates  and  organophosphates  tested, with  a  greater  degree  of  synergism  at  higher  exposure  concen- trations.  However,  the  comparison  between  in  vivo  and  in  vitro

Kok  and  Hasirci  (2004)  carried  out  in  vitro  studies  using  a  binary mixture  of  enzymes,  namely  AChE  and  choline  oxidase,  in  a biosensor.  They  evaluated  the  effect  of  three  CBs,  namely  aldicarb, carbaryl,  and  carbofuran  and  in  binary mixtures  on  AChE  activity.  They  found  that  the  total  inhibition was  not  simply  additive,  but  was  lower  than  the  sum  of  individual inhibition  values.  The  degree  of  difference  between  the  predicted and  actual  inhibition  values  varied  depending  on  the  combinations used  and  their  concentrations  in  the  assay.  It  was  concluded  that there  was  competition  between  the  resulting  in  a  lower  combined their  combinations inhibition  than  expected.  Where  a  pesticide  with  a  lower  afﬁnity was  present  in  high  concentrations,  it  prevented  other  pesticides from  interacting  with  the  enzyme,  thus  lowering  the  overall inhibition. Interactions  between  chemicals  in  a  mixture  can  be  concentra- tion  dependent,  or  concentration  ratio  dependent  (Crofton  et  al., 2005;  Laetz  et  al.,  2009).  In  the  present  study,  the  inhibition  of AChE  with  combined  pesticide  OP  and  CB  exposure  during  in  vitro assays  was  induced  by  the  OP  components  of  the  pesticide mixtures.  Pesticides  also  act  on  biochemical  targets  other  than ChEs.  The  calcium-dependent  A-esterases  can  catalytically  inacti- vate  a  number  of  OPs  without  being  inhibited.

The  model  divergence  ratio  (MDR)  is  the  ratio  of  the  observed  and  predicted  toxicity  at  EC20.  An  MDR  value  of  1  indicates  adherence  to  the  speciﬁed  model.  MDR  values  > <1  indicates  less  than  expected  toxicity  and  hence  antagonism  among indicates  greater  than  expected  toxicity  and  hence  synergism  among  mixture  components.  MDR  values  mixture  components.  The  classiﬁcation  of  type  of  joint  action  is  based  on  the  observed  toxicity  being  outside  the  95%  conﬁdence  limits  of  the  predicted  value. (BChE)  can  also  bind  the  oxon  metabolites  of  OP  insecticides (Richardson  et  al.,  2001)  and  the  carboxylesterases  (CES)  partici- pate  in  stoichiometric  binding  of  OP  molecules  (Sogorb  and Vilanova,  2002).  The  CES  family  of  enzymes  is  a  key  participant  in the  Phase  I  drug  metabolism  process,  catalysing  the  hydrolysis  of  a wide  range  of  ester-  and  amide-containing  compounds. Pyrethroids  do  not  have  an  inhibitory  effect  on  AChE.  In  the present  study,  DLT  and  CYP  in  combination  with  OPs  (TRZ,  MLT  and CPF)  were  highly  synergistic.  According  to  Khan  et  al.  (2013),  OPs could  inhibit  the  detoxiﬁcation  of  SPs  and  increase  the  toxicity  in binary  combinations.  It  was  concluded  that  the  toxicities  of bifenthrin,  cypermethrin  and  deltamethrin  the  resistant ﬂies  could  be  enhanced  by  the  combination population  of  house  ﬁpronil.

In  the  present study  under  in  vitro  conditions,  we  have  used  pure  houseﬂy-head AChE  with  no  A-esterase,  CES  and  BChE  enzyme  activity.  Therefore these  other  enzymes  are  not  producing  the  observed  deviations from  concentration-addition  in  the  binary  combinations  between OPs,  CBs  and  SPs.  However,  A-esterases,  CES  and  BChE  were  not tested  in  the  present  study.  This  should  be  further  investigated  in the  future  studies.  In  the  present  study,  the  EC20 and  EC50 values  of AChE  inhibition  for  CPF,  TRZ,  MCP  and  MLT  in  combination  with DLT  or  CYP  did  not  increase  with  the  increase  in  PYR  concentrations mg/L).  We  hypothesise  that  the  binary  mixture  results (0.1  and of  OPs  and  SPs  were  inﬂuenced  mainly  by  the  OP  component  of  the mixture. Although  attempts  to  account  for  mixtures  have  been  made, these  have  generally  assumed  that  the  toxicity  of  the  mixture conforms  to  the  CA  mode  of  joint  action  (NEPCC, 1999;  ANZECC  and ARMCANZ,  2000).  A  number  of  meta-analyses  of  mixture  toxicity data  have  reported  that  while  many  mixtures  conform  to  CA, between  5%  and  30%  of  mixtures  conform  to  synergism  and therefore  assuming  CA  would  underestimate  their  toxicity  (Warne and  Hawker,  1995;  Deneer,  2000;  Belden  et  al.,  2007).  Few  models predicting  toxic  effects  of  mixtures  have  effectively  dealt  with  the inﬂuence  of  magnitudes  of  exposure  and  dependence  on  the  ratios of  the  component  chemicals.  Future  work  determining  the  effects of  these  pesticide  combinations  to  non-target  organisms  at environmentally  relevant  concentration  is  needed. 5.  Conclusions We  have  shown  that  the  joint  inhibitory  effects  of  mixtures  of OP  and  CB  insecticides  on  houseﬂy-head  AChE  activity  are  not always  dose-additive  in-vitro.  The  concentration  addition  ap- proach  could  severely  underestimate  combined  toxicity  of  OPs where  their  oxon  analog  (metabolite)  is  more  toxic  than  their parent  compound.  The  present  study  has  highlighted  the differential  toxicity  of  binary  combinations  of  OP  and  CB  pesticides under  oxidised  and  un-oxidised  conditions.  Pyrethroids  in combination  with  OPs  and  CBs  were  highly  synergistic.  The  results from  this  in  vitro  study  demonstrate  environmental  concern  on  the

Increased  potency  of  these  OP,  CB  and  SP  in  binary  combinations could  result  in  deleterious  effects  on  non-target  organisms.

Further  research  examining  the  effect  that  low  levels  of  these pesticides  during  in  vivo  exposures  needs  to  be  performed  in  order for  environmental  managers  to  make  informed  decisions.
