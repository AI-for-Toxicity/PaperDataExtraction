The network formation assay characterizes DNT hazard based on changes in network formation but provides no mechanistic information. This study investigated nervous system signaling pathways and upstream physiological regulators underlying chemically induced neural network dysfunction. Rat primary cortical neural networks grown on microelectrode arrays were exposed for 12 days in vitro to cytosine arabinoside, 5-ﬂuorouracil, domoic acid, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, or haloperidol as these exposures altered network formation in previous studies.

MARABLE ET AL. | provided gene expression and metabolomic identiﬁcation, respectively. The integration of differentially expressed genes and metabolites for each neurotoxicant was analyzed using ingenuity pathway analysis. All 6 compounds altered gene expression that linked to developmental disorders and neurological diseases. Other enriched canonical pathways overlapped among compounds of the same class; eg, genes and metabolites altered by both cytosine arabinoside and 5- ﬂuorouracil exposures are enriched in axonal guidance pathways. Integrated analysis of upstream regulators was heterogeneous across compounds, but identiﬁed several transcriptomic regulators including CREB1, SOX2, NOTCH1, and PRODH. These results demonstrate that changes in network formation are accompanied by transcriptomic and metabolomic changes and that different classes of compounds produce differing responses. This approach can enhance information obtained from new approach methodologies and contribute to the identiﬁcation and development of adverse outcome pathways associated with DNT. Key words: adverse outcome pathway; developmental neurotoxicity; environmental chemicals; metabolomics; omics re- search; neural network formation. Over the last decade, there have been several important legal and/or policy decisions that have encouraged the development and use of in vitro approaches for identification of hazard associ- ated with chemical exposure. These include legislative changes such as the REACH act in Europe (European Commission, 2006) and the Lautenberg Chemical Safety Act (United States, 2015) in the United States, and policy decisions such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency memo announcing the intention to develop a new approach methodologies (NAMs) workplan supporting the increased development and imple- mentation of NAMs (Wheeler, 2019). These policy changes have in part been driven by the recognition that for some hazards, data on large numbers of chemicals are lacking, and the use of animal-based testing strategies is insufficient to address this data gap. Further, there is scientific recognition that, for a variety of reasons, animal-based toxicity studies often do not predict adverse outcomes in humans (NRC, 2007). As such, in the last 15 years, there have been significant efforts directed in vitro towards the development and implementation of approaches for hazard assessment. Assessment of developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) hazard has relied heavily on animal-based protocols (EPA 870.6300 [U.S. EPA, 1998] and OECD TG 426 [OECD, 2007]) that assess numerous morphological and behavioral endpoints in offspring exposed, typically perinatally, to chemicals. However, a number of short- comings of in vivo DNT guideline studies have been identified (Tohyama, 2016; Tsuji and Crofton, 2012), including the high cost of conducting the study (approximately $1M/chemical), the large number of animals used (approximately 1000/study), and the amount of time it takes to conduct a DNT guideline study (up to 2 years). One review found that only 15 of 69 guideline DNT studies were used to set points of departure for risk assess- ments (Raffaele et al., 2010), whereas another review indicated that the learning and memory endpoints evaluated in the guideline DNT studies lack sensitivity (Vorhees and Makris, 2015). Further, these studies do not provide any mechanistic in- formation regarding how a chemical may cause developmental neurotoxicity. Finally, because guideline DNT studies are “triggered” by other evidence of neurotoxicity under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, and not at all re- quired under the Toxic Substances Control Act, only a small fraction of chemicals used in the environment have been assessed for DNT (Crofton et al., 2012; Judson et al., 2009). Because of the large number of compounds for which no DNT hazard data are available, there is international agreement that novel approaches to DNT assessment, including in vitro screen- ing approaches will be required in order to address this backlog, as current approaches are no longer sufficient (Fritsche et al., 2018). The lack of data regarding the potential DNT hazard of thou- sands of compounds in commerce, coupled with the limitations DNT guideline studies discussed above has driven efforts to de- velop alternative assays for characterizing this hazard. Because development of the nervous system is complex, with multiple potential targets being expressed in different locations and at different times during development, a battery of in vitro assays has been proposed as a viable approach to assessing DNT haz- ard (Bal-Price et al., 2018). This battery consists of phenotypic assays that evaluate key neurodevelopmental processes such as neural progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation, neu- ronal and glial migration and differentiation, neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis, and network formation (Bal-Price et al., 2018). This battery of assays consists of both animal (rodent) and human cell models. Although these assays are economical and efficient, they provide only limited information on potential mechanisms by which chemicals may be disrupting these criti- cal neurodevelopmental processes. Information from these in vitro assays can be used in Integrated Approaches to Testing and Assessment to inform weight of evidence, fit-for-purpose, screening-level, and/or other regulatory decision scenarios (Paparella et al., 2020). The data from these in vitro assays can provide clues for the development of a more formalized frame- work by providing biological context to reduce the uncertainty of in vitro to in vivo extrapolation and ultimately lead to the de- velopment of possible mechanistic insights associated with DNT (Carlson et al., 2020). Such approaches may inform the de- velopment of adverse outcome pathways (AOPs, Watanabe et al., 2011) for developmental neurotoxicity, which are currently lacking (Bal-Price et al., 2015; Sachana et al., 2018). To address this data gap, this study was conducted as a proof-of-concept, by examining transcriptomic and metabolo- mic responses following exposure to 6 reference chemicals us- ing rat cortical cultures in a multiplexed format as part of the rodent neural network formation assay (NFA; Brown et al., 2016; Frank et al., 2017)). The NFA evaluates chemical effects on for- mation of functional networks of rodent neurons grown on mi- croelectrode arrays (MEAs) from days in vitro (DIV) 0 to 12. To date, this assay has been used to evaluate the potential DNT of over 200 unique compounds (Brown et al., 2016; Frank et al., 2017; Shafer, 2019). It has high sensitivity and specificity (Shafer, 2019), and has been proposed as a component of the in vitro DNT assay battery (Bal-Price et al., 2018). The NFA collects multiple parameters describing chemical effects on the ontog- eny of general activity, bursting activity, and coordinated l D o w n o a d e d f r o m h t t p s : / / i a c a d e m c . o u p . c o m / t o x s c i / l / I / / I / a r t i c e

120 | OMIC ANALYSIS OF ALTERED NETWORK NEURAL FORMATION network activity as well as viability (see Table 2 in Brown et al., 2016). These measures are multiplexed and, due to the noninva- sive nature of MEA recordings, collected at 4 different time points during in vitro network development. This latter charac- teristic allows for the determination of toxicological “tipping points” (Frank et al., 2018; Shah et al., 2016), that demark when network development departs from normal trajectories. In this study, developing neural networks were exposed to concentra- tions of 6 chemicals and electrophysiological data were col- lected as previously described (Brown et al., 2016). At the end of exposure, media and cell lysates were immediately collected for metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses, respectively, in order to test the hypothesis that a combined -omic analysis would identify pathways, biomarkers, and/or critical genes that were altered by chemical exposure at concentrations that are known to alter neural network development. Such information could help to identify putative AOPs (Bal-Price et al., 2015; Sachana et al., 2018; Watanabe et al., 2011) by identifying relationships be- tween key events (KEs) at the cellular and molecular level and linking them to the KE of altered network formation. MATERIALS AND METHODS All data files and scripts supporting this publication are avail- able at DOI: 10.23719/1520859. Rat primary cortical cultures. Primary neocortical cultures were pre- pared from postnatal day 0 Long-Evans rat pups. All animal care and tissue harvesting procedures were approved in advance by the U.S. EPA, National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Detailed methods for the culture and plating density of cells used for this study have been previously described (Brown et al., 2016; Mundy and Freudenrich, 2000; Valdivia et al., 2014). Cortical cells were Table 1. Compounds Tested plated at a density of 150 000 cells per well on 48-well MEA plates (Axion M768-KAP-48) precoated with 0.05% polyethylenimine. Cells were placed in each well via a 25 ll media drop containing 20 ng/ml (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat No. L2020) laminin administered di- rectly onto the MEA. Two hours after plating cells, 475 ll Neurobasal A media (Gibco, Cat No. 10888022) supplemented with B-27 (Gibco, Cat No. 17504044) was added to each well. Compounds and dosing. This study evaluated 6 compounds (Table 1) on 48-well MEA plates, all of which have evidence in the literature of DNT effects in humans or mammalian models (Mundy et al., 2015). The screening approaches used for this evaluation (Malo et al. 2006) tested each of the 6 selected “proof- of-concept” compounds a minimum of 2 times (Brown et al., 2016; Frank et al., 2017), each time using 3 different MEA plates from the same culture. Thus, each compound has been tested previously with 2 biological replicates consisting of 3 technical replicates each. Compounds (purity >95%) were stored as speci- fied by the manufacturer (Table 1) and were prepared as previ- ously described (Frank et al., 2017; Table 1). Briefly, a stock concentration of 30 mM was prepared and serially diluted by half-log increments to 1000(cid:2) (between 0.03 and 10 mM) the de- sired final concentration, then diluted in-well on the 48-well MEA plate 2 h after cell attachment to make a 1(cid:2) exposure solu- tion (between 0.03 and 10 mM) with solvent maintained at 0.1% (vol/vol). Although all compounds were tested over the entire exposure range used in Frank et al. (2017), only selected concen- trations were used for transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis due to limited resources for transcriptomic sample analysis. Solvent control wells containing dimethylsulfoxide or H2O were included to monitor the normal development of cortical cells at final concentrations of 0.1% (vol/vol) and had no effect on net- work function (Brown et al., 2016).

returned to the incubator. After MEA recordings on DIV 5 and 9, the cells received a full media exchange with reexposure to the test compound. Electrophysiology recordings. A 15-min period of spontaneous net- work activity was recorded from each well on DIV 5, 7, 9, and using a Maestro 768-channel amplifier, Middle-man data acqui- sition interface, and Axion Integrated Studio (AxIS) software v2.0 or later (Axion Biosystems, Atlanta, Georgia). Spontaneous activity was measured using a gain of 1200(cid:2) and a sampling frequency of 12.5 kHz. The signal was filtered through a Butterworth band-pass filter (0.1–5000 Hz) prior to measuring online spike detection (threshold ¼ 8(cid:2) RMS noise) using the AxIS adaptive spike detector. All recordings were conducted at 37(cid:3)C with 5% CO2. Generally, root mean square (RMS) noise on each electrode was between 2 and 5 lV; electrodes with RMS noise exceeding 5 lV were grounded and excluded from recordings. Normalizing area under the curve values from the MEA plates. The normalized area under the curve (AUC) values for each com- pound, concentration, and endpoint were determined. The data used for activity were taken from the same cultures that were selected for sequencing and metabolomics. The AUC values were calculated as the trapezoidal AUC from DIV 2 to DIV 12 for each endpoint value from each well. The AUC values were nor- malized by dividing by the median AUC value of controls on the corresponding MEA plate (see Frank et al., 2017). Metabolomic sample extraction, derivatization, and gas chromatogra- phy/mass spectrometry analyses. Following the final DIV 12 MEA recording session, media samples were collected. A volume of 450 ll of media per well was transferred to prelabeled 1.5 ml centrifuge tubes and biological reactions quenched with 50 ll of acetone aliquoted into each tube on ice. The samples were then transferred to the (cid:4)80(cid:3)C freezer prior to gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analyses. Media samples (either test or control) were thawed at room temperature for 1 h and metabolites were simultaneously extracted and derivatized for GC/MS analysis based on the methods of Tao et al. (2008). The organic layer was transferred to GC vials for analysis. GC/MS analyses were conducted on an Agilent 6890 GC interfaced to 5973 MS. Sample extracts were analyzed under full-scan (m/z 50-650), electron ionization-MS conditions. (.AIA) files. All Multivariate statistical analysis of metabolomic samples. Following data collection, each individual chromatogram was exported as netcdf files were imported into Metalign (Lommen, 2009) for spectral preprocessing and alignment fol- lowing the developer’s guidelines for an Agilent GC/MS. Data were then filtered and truncated following the methods of Niu et al. (2014). Multivariate statistical analysis was performed by importing Excel spreadsheets of filtered chromatograms into Metaboanalyst (www.metaboanalyst.ca). Preliminary principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted for the entire dataset following Pareto scaled bins to test for outliers. The relative im- pact of a given chemical exposure was assessed by comparing score values for different treatment classes within a given PCA model. To make these comparisons, the score values for a given component (eg, PC1 scores in a PCA model) were tested for nor- mality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. If found normal, then a 1-way ANOVA test, with Tukey’s post hoc comparison, was conducted. This allowed the determination of significantly different means (95% confidence) of score values for different MARABLE ET AL. | treatment classes.

(Minitab, Univariate statistical analysis of metabolomics. To determine the significance of metabolite changes resulting from the expo- sures, volcano plot analysis was conducted with Metabolanalyst coupling fold change (6 1.8) and t test (p value (cid:5) .05) analyses. Spectral features identified using this approach were putatively identified using commercially available mass-spectral data- bases. (Supplementary Figs. 1–4). Isolation of RNA and sequencing. Total RNA was collected using the Qiagen RNeasy Plus Kit. Two to three wells of identically treated cultures were pooled, representing 1 sample. The exper- iment was repeated on 2 separate cultures. Samples were pooled by serially treating identically treated wells with a vol- ume of 350 ll of lysis buffer with b-mercaptoethanol (Buffer RLT, Qiagen). This volume was added (as described in RNeasy Plus Kit instructions) to a well and mixed for complete lysis be- fore being transferred to the next (identically treated) well(s) to be pooled together. The lysate sample of pooled wells was transferred to a clean 1.5 ml RNase-free plastic tube and the ho- mogenized lysate sample was then taken through the gDNA Eliminator spin column, and RNA was then precipitated and eluted as described in the RNeasy Plus Kit instructions. The Qubit RNA BR (Broad-Range) Assay Kit was used to measure RNA concentration on the Qubit Fluorometer. Samples were stored in a (cid:4)80(cid:3)C freezer until transfer to the NHEERL Genomics Research Core for sequencing. 500 ng total RNA was loaded onto an Apollo 324 automated liquid handler to prepare polyA- selected RNA-seq libraries following manufacturer instructions for a PrepX PolyA mRNA isolation kit (Wafergen). mRNA librar- ies were denatured with NaOH and loaded onto an Illumina NextSeq 500 bench top sequencer at a final dilution of 1.8 pM with 5% PhiX. Reads were delivered in FastQ file format at an av- erage coverage depth of 15.8 (range ¼ 11.0–23.1) reads per sample. Analyzing sequences. The sequencer output data files (FASTQ files) were “trimmed” to remove sequence adapters and other low-quality bases from the ends of reads in Partek Flow (Build v4.0.16.0128, St Louis, Missouri). Read ends were trimmed by quality (Q-scores (cid:5) 7) and reads with length (cid:5) 25 or composed of any 1 base at > 95% frequency were removed by Partek Flow. The files were inspected for pre-alignment and postalignment quality control. The sequence was then aligned to a rat refer- ence genome (Rn6) and transcripts were quantified to the tran- scriptome (RefSeq) by using Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software (STAR2.4.1d, Illumina). Inspection of the postalignment QC metrics was conducted, the reads were mapped to the transcriptome to determine which genes the se- quence represents, and annotation (gene level) was completed in the Partek Flow software. Transcript (gene) abundance levels from reads aligned to a rat genome were quantified using expectation-maximization algorithm (E/M) and normalized by dividing by counts per million (CPM) for the sample, adding 1 to all raw counts, and then log2 transforming. After normalization, a batch effect due to different sequencing runs, which separated rep 1 from reps 2 and 3, was observed. To remove this effect, a general linear model was applied within the Partek Flow envi- ronment. Finally, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the default Partek Gene-Specific Analysis l D o w n o a d e d f r o m h t t p s : / / i a c a d e m c . o u p . c o m / t o x s c i / l / / / I / I a r t i c e

122 | OMIC ANALYSIS OF ALTERED NETWORK NEURAL FORMATION algorithm on pairwise groups (control vs treated) followed by pathway mapping with statistical significance which was as- cribed to score values with a false discovery rate (FDR) value < 0.05 and absolute fold change value of (cid:6) 2.0. No additional mod- els were enabled to lognormally fit the data. Integrated omic analysis. To analyze both the metabolomic and the transcriptomic data, a combination of 2 supervised approaches was used within ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA; Qiagen; see Figure 1). First, an independent analysis of both genes and metabolites was conducted. DEG gene lists (1.86 fold; p value < .05) peak metabolite lists (6 1.8 fold; p value < .05) were also uploaded to IPA and mapped to pathways independently of each other for each compound. Second, following the indepen- dent core analysis for each compound, a combined list of genes and metabolites was created for each compound. Utilizing the canonical pathway and upstream regulator analysis functions in IPA, these lists were evaluated for canonical pathway enrich- ment and potential transcription factor regulators relative to neuronal development. It should be noted that for deltamethrin (DM) and cypermethrin (CM), different treatment concentra- tions were analyzed for transcriptomics and metabolomics due to a clerical error. As insufficient sample and resources were available to repeat the analysis, the results of the combined analysis used the available data. For independent and inte- grated analyses, IPA automatically detected entrez IDs for the transcriptomic data using the rodent database and the metabo- lomic data using the human metabolome database. In both approaches, we focused our analysis to tissues and cells specific to the nervous system, as well as human mapped pathways. Nervous system-related pathways and regulators included se- lect IPA pathway categories like Neurotransmitters and Other l D o w n o a d e d f r o m h t t p s : / / i a c a d e m c . o u p . c o m / t o x s c i / l / I I / / / a r t i c e

Growth Organismal System Signaling, Nervous and Development, Intracellular and Second Messenger Signaling, Growth Factor Signaling, Cytokine Signaling, Cellular Growth, Proliferation and Development, Cell Cycle Regulation, and Disease Specific. These nervous system-related pathway cate- gories were defined by low p values (< .05) and large magnitude absolute changes in z-score relative to the significance thresh- old. Fisher’s Exact test p value was used to find the probability that the combined gene, metabolite list would coincide with the IPA pathway list. Upstream analysis function of potential regu- lators of our lists was based on the number of differentially expressed downstream genes and metabolites in the list and quantified using a Z-score and p value. The Z-score is a correla- tion measure of how consistently the direction of expression changes in the gene metabolite list matches the direction of change from the annotated literature for targets in the regula- tory or biological group. RESULTS The overall approach to this study is depicted in Figure 1. Following treatment of developing cortical neuronal networks with chemicals that previously were shown to alter network develop- ment (Brown et al., 2016; Frank et al., 2017), RNA was isolated from the cell pellet for transcriptomic analysis and media was saved for metabolomic analysis (Figure 1, step 1). At the highest level, we used IPA to probe neurodevelopmental disease (NDD) Categories associated with the responses to chemical treatment that resulted in altered network development. Separate transcriptomic and metabolomic, as well as integrated analyses were conducted (Figure 1, step 2). The results of analyses were then utilized to iden- tify canonical pathways and upstream regulators associated with altered neuronal network formation following compound exposure (Figure 1, step 3). Last, we investigated the molecular relationships identified between the MEA and multi-omic analyses to provide in- formation on the mechanisms underlying disruption of the neuro- developmental process (Figure 1, step 4). Compounds Disrupt Neuronal Network Formation at the Selected Concentrations The compounds tested in this study were selected based on pre- vious activity in the NFA (Brown et al., 2016), and the concentra- tions tested in this study are shown (Table 1) relative to their toxicological tipping point (Frank et al., 2018) and EC50 value for cytotoxicity (Frank et al. 2017); these range from near the cyto- toxicity EC50 (cytosine arabinoside [CA] and 5 fluorouracil [5FU]) to intermediate between these concentrations (DM/CM/haloper- idol [HP]) to near the tipping point concentration (domoic acid [DA]). The toxicological tipping point is the concentration at which network development no longer exhibits recovery from perturbations caused by chemical treatment (ie, homeostasis can no longer compensate for toxicological responses; Frank et al., 2018; Shah et al., 2016). Concentrations were chosen to fall between tipping point and cytotoxicity EC50, as representative of network dysfunction before overt cell death. AUC values for 17 parameters of network formation (eg, mean firing rate, burst rate, interburst interval [IBI], network bursts, etc.) were altered by treatment with all 6 compounds (Figure 2). Overall, most, but not all parameters of network function were reduced by treat- ment, and distinct profiles of activity are evident across the dif- ferent treatments. As these effects were generally consistent with previous results (Brown et al., 2016; Frank et al., 2017), no statistical analysis was conducted. Not surprisingly, CA, which was tested at a concentration near its EC50 value for cytotoxicity MARABLE ET AL. | produced the most robust changes (all decreases) in network function across the most network parameters. Interestingly, 5FU, which was also tested near its EC50 value for cytotoxicity caused more modest changes in network parameters. Although changes induced by DM, CM, and HP were not as pronounced as for the DNA-synthesis inhibitors, there were clear patterns of response, and in the cases of the pyrethroids (DM and CM), showed concentration-dependence as well as a similarity in the profile of effects on network parameters. For example, CM and DM at the lower concentrations exhibited slight increases in IBI and interspike interval in network spikes (ISNetSP) and to a lesser extent, interspike interval (ISI), whereas HP depressed all parameters except for the percentage of spikes in network spikes (%SpNetSP). In contrast, DA, which was tested at a con- centration close to its tipping point, showed small effects on the network function parameters, with the largest effect being an approximately 50% decrease in mutual information (MutInfo). These changes are consistent with effects previously dem- onstrated (Brown et al., 2016; Frank et al., 2017) for these com- pounds on metrics of neural network formation following exposure for 12 DIV. Following the recordings on DIV 12, media samples were collected for metabolomic analysis, and RNA was collected from cell lysates for transcriptomic analysis. Identification of DEGs Corresponds to the Magnitude of Effects on Network Activity Table 2 presents the number of identified DEGs associated with nervous tissue for each compound. The number of DEGs gener- ally correlated with the magnitude of chemical effects on net- work function: 1572 and 304 genes were differentially expressed following treatment with DNA synthesis inhibitors CA and 5FU, respectively. These treatments also caused the most robust alterations in network formation (Figure 2). Although functional changes following DA treatment were subtle, 30 DEGs were identified following treatment with this glutamate receptor ago- nist. A total of 8 and 10 DEGs were identified following treat- ment with voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) modulators CM and DM, respectively, and 11 following treatment with the dopamine receptor antagonist HP. Univariate Statistical Analysis Provides an Untargeted Approach to Identify Metabolites Both PCA and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS- DA) were performed in MetaboAnalyst, to identify outliers and allow visualization of each compound by chemical class, re- spectively.

These metabolites were then iden- tified by a Student’s t test (p (cid:5) .05) comparison across each con- centration compared with solvent matched controls tested as described earlier. PLS-DA models Transcriptomic, Metabolomic, and Combined Analyses Identify Molecular and Cellular Function and NDD Categories Associated With Functional Alterations in Network Development Treatment with the 6 compounds used here resulted in differ- ent transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles (Figure 3). The IPA disease analysis tool of Ingenuity identified functional annota- tions for both DEGs and metabolites, and the integration of genes and metabolites, providing 3 major characterizations. The identified cellular and molecular events were classified by molecular and cellular function, and diseases and disorders, representing 2 hierarchical levels of biology from high levels (diseases and disorders) to molecular levels to aid in translation of results.

Because CA produced both the most robust changes in DEGs and metabolites, the presentation of results will focus on this exposure as an example and compare and contrast effects of the other compounds to CA. The analy- ses of all compounds are available in the Supplementary Materials. Transcriptomic analysis in IPA identified 5 cellular and mo- lecular functions that were associated with CA exposure during network development; cell death and survival, cell morphology, cell growth and proliferation, cellular development, and cellular movement (Figure 4). Like the transcriptomic analysis, metabo- lomic analysis also identified cellular growth and proliferation. However, the metabolomic analysis identified cell-to-cell sig- naling and interaction, amino acid metabolism, drug metabo- lism, and molecular transport. When transcriptomic and metabolomic information were combined, this analysis identi- fied cellular development, cellular movement, cellular growth and proliferation, cell morphology, and cell death and survival as molecular and cellular pathways altered by CA. The cellular and molecular functions and disease categories that were associated with treatment for the remaining compounds had a high degree of overlap (Figure 4) with those identified for CA. In the combined analysis, cell-to-cell signal- ing and interaction was identified for 4 compounds (CM, DM, HP, and DA), while cell morphology (CA, CM, and DM), cell death and survival (CA, 5FU, and CM), and cell function and maintenance (5FU, DM, and HP) were each associated with compounds. l / I / I / / a r t i c e

A common set of 5 disease and disorder categories were altered by the compounds. Values shown are the (cid:4)log (p values), whereas the vertical-dotted line represents the level of signiﬁ- cance (p < .05). When examining NDD categories associated with the tran- scriptomic and metabolomic responses to CA, transcriptomic responses identified 5 categories; neurological diseases, organ- ismal injury and abnormality, psychological disorders, heredi- tary disorders, and skeletal and muscle disorders, whereas the metabolomic responses identified 3 of these 5 (neurological dis- ease, psychological disorders, and organismal injury and abnor- mality) and the additional category of cardiovascular disease (Figure 5). In the combined analysis the disease categories of neurological disease, organismal injury and abnormalities, psy- chological disorders, hereditary disorders, and skeletal and muscle disorders were significant (Bonferroni’s test, p < .05; Figure 5). These categories were prevalent across all compounds in the combined analysis; with all 5 identified for 5FU, 3/5 for DM and DA, and 2/5 for CM and HP (Figure 5). Organismal injury and abnormalities were identified for all 6 compounds, whereas neurological disease was identified for 5/6 compounds (DA be- ing the exception) and psychological disorder for 3/6 (CA, 5FU, and DA). observed between the compounds tested (Table 3). The only pathway common between CA and 5FU was axonal guidance signaling (Figure 6). In contrast, this pathway was not among the top pathways identified for the remaining 4 compounds, but tRNA charging was common among these 4 chemicals and 5FU. DA, CM, DM, and HP were associated with several different bio- synthesis and degradation pathways, although none of them were common across all 4 of these compounds (Table 3). Identification of Upstream Regulators Following Exposure Analysis of upstream regulators for the test chemicals revealed both common regulators as well as regulators unique to each compound (Table 4). SOX2 was common to both CA and 5FU. Although LOC102724788/PRODH was common to CM and DA, otherwise, each compound had different profiles of upstream regulators. All of the identified upstream regulators have impor- tant roles in neurodevelopment, as indicated in Tables 5 and 6. DISCUSSION Identification of Canonical Pathways Altered Following Exposure Our analysis identified 5 canonical pathways associated with CA: CREB signaling in neurons, axonal guidance signaling, hu- man embryonic stem cell pluripotency, hepatic fibrosis/hepatic stellate cell activation, and osteoarthritis pathway. It is at the level of canonical pathways that even more divergence is This study demonstrates that a multi-omic approach can iden- tify critical pathways involved in neurodevelopment in vivo at concentrations of compounds that induce changes in network formation in vitro.

Putative adverse outcome pathway linked to cytosine arabinoside exposure. Illustrated here is a putative adverse outcome pathway (AOP) for altered neuro- physiology that is based on data (blue outline) from the microelectrode array network formation assay as well as other in vitro developmental neurotoxicity assays (see Harrill et al., 2018) after cytosine arabinoside exposure. Underneath the putative AOP are the cellular and molecular categories (orange), disease and disorder categories (light blue), and canonical pathways (light green) that were identiﬁed by -omic approaches following treatment with cytosine arabinoside. Overlap of the orange and light green bars is approximate. Key event relationships that are well established are indicated with solid arrows, while those that are postulated are indicated by dashed arrows. classes of compounds evoked different -omic responses, with compounds from the same class (eg, CA and 5FU) evoking simi- lar responses while compounds from different classes (eg, DM and HP) evoked differential responses. This result suggests that these compounds are disrupting neural network formation through alteration of different pathways, but potentially with class-specific AOPs. The need for novel methods to evaluate chemicals for DNT hazard is now well-established. In the last decade, a variety of in vitro assays based on the ability of chemicals to disrupt key neurodevelopmental events have been developed. Many of these neurodevelopmental events, such as proliferation, neurite outgrowth, synaptogenesis, etc., can be considered as KEs that could be involved in AOPs for compounds with DNT hazard po- tential. Among these assays, the neural NFA (Brown et al., 2016; Frank et al., 2017; Shafer, 2019) is unique in that it evaluates neu- ronal function, rather than structural or molecular endpoints. However, the NFA as currently performed does not provide any mechanistic information. Given that “alterations in network function” are listed as a KE in 5 AOPs found on the AOPWiki (https://aopwiki.org/events/386; last accessed January 5, 2022), understanding in more detail the pathways underlying altera- tions in network formation can serve to strengthen the existing AOPs involving this KE, and identify additional putative AOPs. All 6 compounds tested in this study have been reported to cause DNT in mammals (Mundy et al., 2015). At the highest level of organization evaluated in this study (NDD), all 6 compounds were associated with a highly common set of categories for both cellular and molecular function as well as disease and de- velopment disorders (Figs. 4 and 5). The categories were consis- tent across the transcriptomic, metabolomic, and combined analyses, indicating common and robust responses to com- pound treatment. This information establishes an important linkage from the in vitro work conducted here to in vivo, human adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes by demonstrating that the -omic changes induced in vitro are disrupting some of the same processes that result in human NDD states. It is important to note that we are not postulating that exposure to these l D o w n o a d e d f r o m h t t p s : / / i a c a d e m c . o u p . c o m / t o x s c i / l I / / / / I a r t i c e

That chemical disruption of nervous sys- tem development and neurodevelopmental diseases has com- monalities at the disease and developmental disorder level is not unexpected, nor is it surprising that common cellular and molecular categories were impacted by these chemicals. It is noteworthy that the overall functional response of the networks was also consistent for all compounds, being generally de- creased in both the limited analysis in this study, as well as the more complete analyses in previous studies (Brown et al., 2016; Frank et al., 2017). Thus, there is general agreement between the functional and -omic responses at the highest levels. When examining canonical pathways associated with the alterations in network function; however, some divergence begins to appear between the different classes of compounds. Axonal guidance signaling was associated only with the DNA synthesis inhibitors (CA and 5FU), whereas tRNA charging was common among 5 of the compounds. This could be a result of an integrated stress response (Kapur et al., 2017). Alteration of biosynthesis pathways was a common finding among the remaining 4 compounds (CM, DM, DA, and HP); however, all of the specific pathways identified were unique to each com- pound. Canonical pathway and upstream regulator identifica- tion for each compound may play a role in different KEs of neurodevelopment, which are all essential to formation of neu- ronal networks (Reiner et al., 2016). A similar theme was identi- fied at the level of upstream regulators associated with compound exposure, with common regulators as well as unique regulators associated with each compound or among com- pounds with similar mechanisms. SOX2 was common to both of the DNA synthesis inhibitors, whereas LOC102724788/PRODH was common to CM and DA, otherwise the upstream regulators were unique for each compound. Overall, these results help us build putative AOPs based on the multi-omic responses to compound exposures studied here. At the highest level of organization, they converge upon a com- mon physiological response (decreased activity in network for- mation patterns) and disease categories (eg, neurological disorders, organismal injury, and abnormalities). As one begins to explore further the canonical pathways contributing to these disease categories, some common pathways are found (eg, axo- nal guidance), but more importantly different pathways begin to emerge that can be associated with different compound clas- ses and their modes of action. This hypothesis is further sup- ported by the analysis of upstream regulators, which show some commonalities across chemicals, but more broadly identi- fied unique patterns of response for each compound. These results suggest that the actions on network function are the re- sult of not a single AOP contributing to the decrease in activity, but rather a network of AOPs converging to impact physiological function as measured by the MEA. It is likely that decreases in network function following exposure to these compounds are the summation of several different events, such as decreases in neurite outgrowth, synaptogenesis, synaptic support from glia, and even differing levels of cytotoxicity/cell death. Thus, it could be expected that an interconnected AOP network will evolve with additional studies. This information can then be combined with information from other sources to begin to develop putative AOPs for further exploration (Figure 1, step 4). An online analysis tool DAVID could be used as a complimentary source of interest in future projects to compare and potentially confirm which dysregu- lated signaling pathways are enriched relative to the IPA identi- fied key upstream regulators and their predicted activation. Both CA and 5FU are known inhibitors of proliferating cells by inhibiting DNA synthesis, CA also causes oxidative stress in neurons (Geller et al., 2001). These may serve as initial KEs, where exposure of the cortical cultures used here results in de- creased proliferation of the glial cells and increased oxidative stress in neurons. Further, according to Harrill et al. (2018), both CA and 5FU increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation in neuroprogenitor cells, and this also has been reported in pri- mary cultures of cortical neurons (Geller et al., 2001). Neurite outgrowth has also been reported to be decreased by CA (Harrill et al., 2018) at concentrations similar to those used in this study. It has been demonstrated previously that compounds that de- crease neurite outgrowth in cortical cells can also decrease net- work formation (Robinette et al., 2011). These effects on apoptosis, proliferation, and neurite outgrowth were nonselec- tive, indicating that they were associated with loss of cell viabil- ity (Harrill et al., 2018). Both CA and 5FU also alter network formation, not only here but also in previous experiments (Brown et al., 2016; Frank et al., 2017). Thus, one can postulate an AOP as illustrated in Figure 6, wherein the actions of CA on neu- rons and glia in the cortical culture converge on decreased neu- rite outgrowth and ultimately result in decreased network formation. The different cellular and molecular and disease cat- egories, as well as the canonical pathways can then be overlaid onto the putative AOP. Finally, one can begin to investigate this AOP in a more rigorous manner by manipulating the upstream regulators such as, SOX2, CREB1 (CA), NOTCH1 (5FU), and the other regulators in Table 4 to build confidence in the KE l D o w n o a d e d f r o m h t t p s : / / i a c a d e m c . o u p . c o m / t o x s c i / l / / / I / I a r t i c e

Such an approach can be taken for the other compound clas- ses as well. At concentrations similar to those used here, HP was a selective inhibitor of neurite initiation in both hN2 and rat cortical neurons (EC30 ¼ approximately 3 mM), and nonselec- tively inhibited synaptogenesis at higher concentrations (Harrill et al., 2018). Data for DA and CM were not available from Harrill et al. (2018). In a recently released report, neither DA nor CM was active in a variety of in vitro DNT assays examining neurite out- growth, proliferation, and glial function, suggesting its actions on network formation are relatively specific (Masjosthusmann et al., 2020). However, in a rat neural stem cell model, DA was reported to reduce the differentiation of stem cells into astro- cytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes at noncytotoxic concen- trations (Gill and Kumara, 2019) Further, higher concentrations reduced axonal length (Gill and Kumara, 2019). DM was more selective than some of the other chemicals tested here in that it decreased only neurite maturation and synaptogenesis at con- centrations (EC30 ¼ approximately 9 mM) that were about two- fold below cytotoxicity (Harrill et al., 2018). Putative AOPs for DM, HP, and DA are presented in Supplementary Figures 5–7, re- spectively. Note that for DA, the level of information regarding potential KEs identifies several important data gaps. All of these putative AOPs require additional investigation and further de- velopment. In particular, the levels of evidence for each pro- posed KE need to be further evaluated and KERs need to be established. However, knowledge of the upstream regulators Several important caveats should be considered with respect to the current dataset. First, the samples for the -omic responses were collected only at the end of the exposure period over which network formation was evaluated with MEAs. Thus, the pathways and regulators identified here may not represent the initial response to perturbation of network development, but rather the downstream consequences of those initial responses. Although metabolomic time-course data could be collected easily by simply collecting media samples over time, collection of a transcriptomic response time-course would re- quire the use of sister cultures such that cells could be lysed and RNA collected at each timepoint. Second, it should be recog- nized that the primary cortical culture used here is a mixed cul- ture consisting of excitatory and inhibitory neurons as well as glia. Therefore, these individual cell types may respond differ- ently, and obscure the ability to detect an influential response that is not occurring in the majority of cells or in a dominant cell population. Under the protocol used here, it would not be possible to discriminate differential responses of the cell types, and small responses in a single cell type might not be large enough to reach the limits of detection/significance, which could influence the identified pathways. Similarly, the metabo- lomics analysis was based on media samples, not intracellular metabolites. It is possible that such an approach favored detec- tion of metabolites more associated with cellular death or al- tered membrane integrity over those that might reflect other l I / / I / / a r t i c e

biochemical processes. The advantage of this approach is that it would lend itself to repeated metabolomic analyses over time from the same well/population of cells. Third, the concentra- tions tested in this study were limited, and covered a different range of responses for the different compounds. DA was tested at the lowest concentration, which was near its toxicological “tipping point” concentration (Frank et al., 2018) where the ho- meostatic compensatory processes of the cell are overwhelmed. CM, DM, and HP were all tested at 10- to 100-fold higher than their respective tipping points, but were not cytotoxic (CM and DM) or were well below (HP) their cytotoxicity EC50 values. In contrast, the DNT synthesis inhibitors were tested at concentra- tions that were close to or slightly exceeding their EC50 values for cytotoxicity. Consequently, these differences may also con- tribute to the differential responses observed for each com- pound in the -omic responses. Since few DEGs went into the analysis for CM, DM, and HP, it was more difficult to identify commonly enriched pathways. Finally, the present experiments used primary cultures of rodent neurons, and therefore the results obtained here may not apply directly to humans. Additional studies are needed to resolve these questions, but the present results demonstrate that this approach can identify and support hypotheses regarding the mechanisms underlying alterations in neural network formation that can then be inves- tigated further. Such an approach will provide valuable infor- mation for AOP development. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates the feasibility of this approach in obtaining -omic information from NFAs that incorporate rodent (or in the future, human) neuronal models. The transcriptomic and metabolomic responses help reinforce the functional MEA observations, suggesting that changes in these pathways may underlie the functional changes. This justifies further studies into the mechanisms of action in rat cortical cells and the rela- tionship of these changes to -omic changes in neurodevelop- mental disorders. Future studies could explore which DEGs and/ or metabolites are most predictive for network dysfunction. SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Supplementary data are available at Toxicological Sciences online.
