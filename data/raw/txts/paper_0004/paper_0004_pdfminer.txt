However, conventional  single  well-MEA  systems  lack  the  throughput  necessary  for  screening  large  numbers  of uncharacterized  compounds.  Recently,  multi-well  MEA  (mwMEA)  formats  have  become  available  to address  the  need  for  increased  throughput.  The  current  experiments  examined  the  effects  of  a  training set  of  30  chemicals  on  spontaneous  activity  in  networks  of  cortical  neurons  grown  on  mwMEA  plates. Each  plate  contained  12  wells  with  64  microelectrodes/well,  for  a  total  of  768  channels.  Of  the chemicals  evaluated,  23  were  known  to  alter  neuronal  function  in  vivo  (‘‘positives’’),  including GABAergic  and  3  glutamatergic  antagonists/agonists,  4  pyrethroids,  3  metals,  2  cholinesterase  inhibitors, 2  nicotinic  acetylcholine  receptor  agonists,  valproic  acid,  verapamil,  and  ﬂuoxetine.  Seven  compounds expected  to  have  no  effect  on  neuronal  function  were  tested  as  ‘‘negatives’’  (glyphosate,  acetaminophen, salicylic  acid,  paraquat,  saccharin,  D-sorbitol  and  amoxicillin).  Following  collection  of  33  min  of  baseline activity,  chemical  effects  (50  mM  or  highest  soluble  concentration)  were  recorded  for  33  min.  Twenty  of the  positives  altered  the  mean  network  spike  rate  by  more  than  the  14%  threshold  (two  standard deviations  from  the  mean  for  DMSO  control).  The  three  positives  without  effect  were  bifenthrin,  nicotine and  imidacloprid.  None  of  the  negative  compounds  caused  a  change  in  activity  beyond  the  threshold. Based  on  these  results,  the  mwMEA  assay  has  both  high  sensitivity  (87%  identiﬁcation  of  positive compounds)  and  speciﬁcity  identiﬁcation  of  negative  compounds).  These  experiments demonstrate  the  capacity  of  mwMEAs  to  screen  compounds  for  neurotoxic  effects  mediated  by  a broad  variety  of  mechanisms. (100% Published  by  Elsevier  Inc. 1.  Introduction The  National  Academy  of  Sciences  report  on  ‘‘Toxicity  testing  in the  21st  century’’  highlighted  the  need  for  efﬁcient  in  vitro  methods to  screen  chemicals  for  their  potential  to  cause  toxicity  (NRC, 2007).

Such  screening  approaches  will  need  to link  changes  measured  at  the  cellular  or  subcellular  level  to adverse  effects  through  a  toxicity  pathway  so  that  there  will  be conﬁdence  in  predicting  toxicological  outcomes  in  vivo. for  which Many  HTS/HCS  endpoints  assess  changes  in  biochemical  and/or cellular  morphology  markers,  such  as  enzyme  activity,  receptor binding  afﬁnity,  cell  morphology  (Radio  and  Mundy,  2008),  or physiological  endpoints,  such  as  regulation  of  intracellular  calcium (Pereira  et  al.,  2009;  Cao  et  al.,  2010,  2011a;  Liu  et  al.,  2010), sodium  (Cao  et  al.,  2011b),  membrane  potential  (Joesch  et  al., 2008)  and  ion  channel  function  (Dunlop  et  al.,  2008;  Castle  et  al., 2009).  When  considering  the  problem  of  screening  compounds  for the  potential  to  disrupt  nervous  system  function,  physiological assessment  is  crucial,  as  disruption  of  ion  channels,  receptors  and other  critical  determinants  of  neuronal  excitability  are  key  events in  the  toxicity  pathways  of  many  known  neurotoxicants.  Disrup- tion  of  neuronal  excitability  produces  substantial  and  rapid disruption  of  nervous  system  physiology,  and  often  precedes  or

(e.g.  changes occurs  in  the  absence  of  other  biochemical  or  morphological changes.  Examples  include  insecticides,  a  variety  of  convulsants and  metals,  as  well  as  a  wide  range  of  natural  toxins.  However, current  in  vitro  assays  based  on  biochemical  and  morphological changes  are  not  optimized  for  detecting  this  type  of  toxicity.  These assays  do  not  incorporate  measurement  of  the  key  events  in  the toxicity  pathways  of  such  neurotoxicants  in intracellular  ion  concentrations  are  secondary  events),  or  are  not amenable  to  collecting  data  at  a  rate  which  can  capture  the  most rapid  neurophysiological  events,  for  example  disruption  of voltage-gated  sodium  channels  and  action  potential  generation by  pyrethroid  insecticides.  By  contrast,  currently  available electrophysiological  approaches  are  not  well  designed  for  toxicity screening,  as  these  assays  typically  consider  only  one  potential target  at  a  time  (e.g.  a  particular  ion  channel)  and  often  employ non-neuronal  expression  systems  rather  than  neuronal  tissue. Furthermore,  neither  biochemical  nor  HTS  physiological  (e.g.  patch clamp)  approaches  consider  chemical  effects  on  neuronal  network function.  Many  of  these  traditional  assays  were  designed  as targeted  screens  for  pharmaceutical-lead  compound  development and  lack  the  ability  to  detect  a  broad  spectrum  of  different neurotoxicants.  Thus,  efﬁcient  screening  assays  that  detect neurotoxic  or  neuroactive  chemicals  based  on  changes  in  function are  lacking,  particularly  those  that  are  sensitive  to  changes mediated  by  disruption  of  a  variety  of  different  toxicity  pathways. One  physiological  approach  that  addresses  these  limitations  is in  vitro  microelectrode  array  (MEA)  recording.  Using  MEAs, spontaneous  and  evoked  activity  in  neuronal  networks  can  be recorded  from  a  variety  of  different  neuronal  preparations, including  primary  cultures,  tissue  slices  and  intact  retinas. Neuronal  activity  in  cultures  grown  on  MEAs  is  sensitive  to  a variety  of  drugs  and  chemicals  and  responds  to  a  broad  spectrum  of pharmaceutical  compounds  (Gross  et  al.,  1997).  As  such,  neuronal networks  on  MEAs  are  a  potential  method  of  assessing  effects  of many  different  pharmacological  classes  of  drugs  and  chemicals  on nervous  system  function.  To  date,  assessment  of  chemical  effects using  MEAs  has  been  primarily  on  a  chemical-by-chemical  basis  to understand  the  toxicity  of  individual  chemicals  or  chemical  classes (Keefer  et  al.,  2001;  Gramowski  et  al.,  2000;  Gopal,  2003;  for review,  see  Johnstone  et  al.,  2010).  Use  of  MEAs  has  been  proposed as  an  in  vitro  neurotoxicity  screening  method  (Johnstone  et  al., 2010)  and  a  recent  study  demonstrated  consistent  reproducibility and  reliability  of  MEA  measurements  across  ﬁve  laboratories (Novellino  et  al.,  2011).  One  limitation  of  MEA  approaches  is  that throughput  of  this  methodology  has  been  low  and  is  limited  by  the MEA  hardware.  To  date,  only  one  publication  has  assessed  the ability  of  MEAs  to  screen  a  set  of  twenty  environmental  chemicals (Defranchi  et  al.,  2011).  In  this  study,  activity  of  chemicals  was determined  by  conducting  cumulative  concentration–response assessments,  which  is  time-consuming  and  limits  the  number  of chemicals  that  can  be  assessed.  A  more  efﬁcient  approach  would  be to  screen  compounds  at  a  single  concentration  to  identify  those that  are  ‘‘hits’’  and  then  characterize  concentration–responses  if desired.  However,  experiments  have  not  been  conducted  to  assess this  approach  for  its  ability  to  detect  neuroactive  and  neurotoxic compounds.  Thus,  the  goal  of  the  current  experiments  was  to evaluate  the  ability  of  MEAs  to  detect  neuroactive  and  neurotoxic chemical  effects  on  the  basis  of  testing  a  single  concentration.  To do  so,  these  experiments  examined  the  effects  of  a  set  of environmental  chemicals  and  drugs  on  spontaneous  network activity  in  primary  cortical  cultures  using  a  768-channel,  multi- well-MEA  (mwMEA)  system.  The  present  study  employed  the concept  of  a  ‘‘training  set’’  of  chemicals  outlined  by  Crofton  et  al. (2011),  wherein  the  chemicals  selected  for  testing  were  well characterized  in  terms  of  their  ability  to  alter  (or  not  alter) neurophysiological  endpoints.  This  allows  for  assessment  of mwMEAs  to  identify  and  prioritize  compounds  for  additional testing. 2.  Materials  and  methods 2.1.  Chemicals listed The  sources,  purities  and  vehicles  used  to  dissolve  test chemicals  are  in  Table  1.  Unless  otherwise  noted,  all chemicals  were  prepared  as  50  mM  stock  solutions  in  their respective  solvents,  stored  at  (cid:2)20  8C  in  amber  glass  vials  treated with  Sigmacote  and  diluted  1:1000  into  the  media  for  a  ﬁnal concentration  of  50  mM.  The  following  considerations  were important  in  the  selection  of  these  chemicals:  (1)  selection  of  a broad  variety  of  different  potential  mechanisms  of  action  (i.e. potential  toxicity  pathways),  (2)  previous  data  characterizing  the ability  (or  lack  thereof)  of  the  drugs  or  chemicals  to  disrupt spontaneous  network  activity,  (3)  known  ability  to  affect  function of  the  nervous  system,  in  vivo  and  (4)  previous  use  of  the compound  as  a  negative  control  in  neurotoxicity  assays.  For  most chemicals,  previously  published  data  were  used  to  establish  their activity  on  MEAs,  and  references  are  provided  in  Table  1.  Of  the compounds  selected,  23  were  known  to  alter  neuronal  function, while  7  are  not  expected  to  exhibit  neurotoxicity  in  vivo.  All  other chemicals  were  obtained  from  commercial  vendors  and  were reagent  quality  or  better. 2.2.  Multi-well  MEA  plates Microelectrode  array  plates  were  composed  of  12  wells  with each  well  containing  an  array  of  64  embedded  nano-porous platinum  electrodes  (30  mm  diameter,  200  mm  center-to-center spacing),  for  a  total  of  768  channels  (Axion  Biosystems  Inc.,  Atlanta, GA).  To  prepare  the  plates  for  culture,  the  mwMEAs  were  placed  in a  55  8C  oven  overnight.  After  removal,  each  plate  was  submerged  in ethanol  (70%)  for  1  h.  After  removing  the  ethanol  and  air-drying, each  well  was  coated  with  a  50  mg/mL  solution  of  poly-L-lysine (Sigma  Chemical,  St.  Louis,  MO).  The  solution  was  removed  after 1  h,  and  the  plates  were  dried  and  stored  at  18  8C  until  the  day  of culture.  Note:  Since  completing  these  studies,  we  have  found  that the  plates  can  be  sterilized  by  being  submerged  in  ethanol  for 5  min,  air  dried  and  placed  in  the  55  8C  oven  for  3–4  h  (upside down  with  the  lids  on). 2.3.  Cell  culture  on  MEAs Cells  were  prepared  from  Long-Evans  rats  on  postnatal  day  0–1. The  pups  were  decapitated,  and  the  neocortex  was  separated  from the  brain  and  placed  in  cortical  buffer  (127  mM  NaCl,  5  mM  KCl, 170  mM  Na2HPO4,  205  mM  KH2PO4,  5  mM  glucose,  59  mM  sucrose, 100  U/mL  penicillin/streptomycin,  pH  7.4).  The  cortex  was  minced ﬁnely  with  scissors  and  triturated  until  homogenous.  Cells  were then  ﬁltered  through  a  100  mm  screen.  The  electrode  ﬁeld  in  each well  was  coated  with  laminin  at  the  beginning  of  the  culture  by placing  a  50  mL  drop  of  laminin  (Sigma)  solution  (1  mg/mL)  in  the center  of  the  well.  Upon  completion  of  the  dissection  ((cid:3)45  min), the  laminin  was  removed  by  aspiration  and  50  mL  of  media containing  2.5  (cid:4)  105 cells  was  placed  directly  over  the  electrode ﬁeld  within  each  well.  Cells  were  left  to  adhere  for  10–15  min before  adding  1  mL  of  Neurobasal-A  (500  mL Neurobasal-A  (GIBCO),  14  g  sucrose  (Sigma),  1.25  mL  glutamine (200  mM,  GIBCO),  5  mL  glutamate  (2.5  mM,  Sigma),  5  mL  penicil- lin/streptomycin  (Sigma),  50  mL  FBS  (GIBCO),  pH  7.4).  The  day following  the  cell  plating  (day  in  vitro  (DIV  1))  NBA  media  was replaced  with  NBA  +  B27  media  (500  mL  Neurobasal-A,  14  g sucrose,  1.25  mL  glutamine  (200  mM),  5  mL  glutamate  (2.5  mM), (NBA)  media E.R.

For  lead  a  30  mM  concentration  was  used. c Addresses:  Sigma  Aldrich  Chemical  Company,  St.  Louis,  MO;  Chem  Service,  West  Chester,  PA;  ICN  Biomedicals,  Irvine,  CA. 5  mL  penicillin/streptomycin,  10  mL  B-27  (GIBCO),  pH  7.4).  At  DIV 4  NBA  +  B27  media  was  replaced  with  glutamate-free  NBA  +  10%, FBS  media.  The  plates  were  checked  at  least  once  every  7  days  for evidence  of  evaporation.  If  evaporation  was  apparent,  media  was removed  from  all  wells  and  replaced  with  1–1.5  mL  fresh  culture media. 2.4.  MEA  recording Spontaneous  network  activity  from  cortical  cultures  grown  on MEA  plates  was  recorded  using  hardware  and  software  from  Axion Biosystems.  The  hardware  consisted  of  the  Maestro  768-channel ampliﬁer,  Middle-man  data  acquisition  interface,  and  a  personal computer.  Data  acquisition  for  the  channels  was  managed  by  the software,  Axion’s  Integrated  Studio  (AxIS  1.4.2).  Channels  were sampled  simultaneously  with  a  gain  of  1200(cid:4)  and  a  sampling  rate of  12.5  kHz/channel.  On-line  spike  detection  was  done  with  the AxIS  adaptive  spike  detector,  a  minor  variant  of  the  ‘AdaBandFlt’ detector  method  described  in  (Bifﬁ  et  al.,  2010).  All  recordings were  conducted  at  37  8C. Between  DIV  6  and  14  plates  containing  the  cultures  were placed  into  the  Maestro  and  spontaneous  activity  of  each  well  was evaluated  to  determine  culture  viability.  Application  of  the  test chemicals  occurred  between  DIV  12  and  22,  with  a  median  of DIV  for  all  plates.  Any  wells  that  did  not  show  spontaneous  activity on  the  day  planned  for  the  experiment  were  not  treated  with  a chemical.  Any  electrodes  with  rms-noise  levels  >10  mV  were grounded.  The  experimental  protocol  for  testing  the  chemical training  set  is  summarized  in  Fig.  1  and  described  in  detail  below. For  recordings,  a  Butterworth  band-pass  ﬁlter  (with  a  high-pass cutoff  of  300  Hz  and  low-pass  cutoff  of  5000  Hz)  was  applied  along with  a  variable  threshold  spike  detector  set  at  8(cid:4)  standard (one  well  each) deviation  of  the  rms-noise  on  each  channel.  Baseline  recordings (33  min)  were  taken  and  data  were  saved  to  3  different  ﬁle  types simultaneously;  a  raw  data  ﬁle  (*.raw  ﬁle)  that  included  all  data,  a spike  counts  ﬁle  (*.csv  ﬁle)  that  included  the  spikes  per  electrode with  a  1  s  bin  time,  and  an  alpha  map  (*.map  ﬁle)  that  included spike  timing  and  proﬁle  information.  Stock  solutions  of  chemicals (1  mL)  were  added  to  each  well  by  diluting  the  solution  in  200  mL  of media  from  the  appropriate  well,  then  returning  the  media  and chemical  to  its  well  of  origin.  The  particular  chemical  treatment that  each  well  received  was  determined  by  a  web-based randomization  procedure  (www.randomizer.org).  Each  plate  also received  only  1  mL contained  wells  dimethylsulfoxide  (DMSO,  Sigma)  and  bicuculline  methiodide (50  mM  BIC,  Sigma),  the  latter  of  which  was  evaluated  as  an endpoint  selective  control  which  increased  activity  (Crofton  et  al., 2011).  DMSO  was  used  as  a  vehicle  control  even  though  some chemicals  were  dissolved  in  water;  the  ﬁnal  concentration  of DMSO  or  water  added  to  each  well  was  0.1%  (1  mL/mL),  which  did not  alter  pH  or  ionic  balance.  Recordings  (33  min)  with  the chemical  treatment  were  taken,  collecting  the  same  ﬁle  types  as during  the  baseline.  Finally,  1  mM  tetrodotoxin  (TTX)  was  added  to each  well  and  10  min  of  activity  was  recorded.  Addition  of  TTX served  as  an  assay  selective  control  that  decreased  activity.  To conﬁrm  results,  a  small  number  of  recordings  in  single  well  MEAs were  conducted  using  hardware  and  software  from  Multichannel Systems  (Reutlingen,  Germany)  as  previously  described  (Meyer et  al.,  2008). that After  experimental  data  were  collected,  wells  were  cleaned  by soaking  with  1  mL  of  a  solution  of  1(cid:4)  phosphate  buffered  saline (PBS)  and  (cid:3)1.5  g  pancreatin  for  5–12  h.  Wells  were  rinsed  3(cid:4)  with deionized  water  and  plates  were  placed  in  a  55  8C  oven  overnight. Plates  were  then  submerged  in  ethanol  (70%)  for  1  h  and  coated  in

Primary  cultures  of  cortical  neurons  are  grown  in  12  well  MEA plates  for  12–22  days  in  vitro  (DIV).  The  mwMEA  plate  is  shown  in  the  upper  left  hand  corner  of  the  ﬁgure.

All  ﬁlters  and spike  detectors  are  applied  online  as  part  of  Axion’s  Integrated  Studio  (AxIS)  software.  An  example  screenshot  showing  the  spontaneous  activity  in  one  well  of  the  12  well plate  is  illustrated,  along  with  an  inset  showing  an  example  of  a  burst  of  action  potentials  resulting  from  spontaneous  activity.  The  scale  bar  is  50  ms  and  20  mV.  As  indicated, for  each  experiment,  30  min  of  control  activity  was  recorded,  followed  by  30  min  in  the  presence  of  a  training  set  chemical.  Speciﬁc  details  are  provided  in  Section  2. poly-L-lysine  for  reuse.  Each  plate  was  used  between  2  and  5  times. A  check  for  delamination  of  the  bisphenol-A  complex1 epoxy  that insulates  the  electrodes  was  performed  following  the  second  or third  use  and  before  every  additional  use  thereafter.  For  this,  70% ethanol  (200  mL)  was  placed  in  the  center  of  each  well  before adding  1  mL  1(cid:4)  PBS  buffer  and  placing  the  plate  in  the  Maestro system.  Mean  referencing  (noise  subtraction)  was  turned  off  and the  baseline  noise  was  examined.  Delamination  was  the  attributed cause  if  more  than  50%  of  the  electrodes  had  baseline  activity  of less  than  6  mV,  and  such  plates  were  not  reused. 2.5.  Data  analysis The  spike  count  ﬁles  generated  from  recordings  were  used  to calculate  the  number  of  active  electrodes  (AEs;  deﬁned  as  an electrode  having  an  average  of  more  than  5  spikes/min)  in  each well,  the  average  per-well  mean  ﬁring  rate  (MFR  or  spikes/min), and  the  standard  deviation  of  the  average  per-well  MFR.  The  ﬁrst 3  min  of  each  data  ﬁle  was  removed  in  order  to  let  the  activity stabilize  in  the  Maestro.  Data  from  wells  that  contained  fewer  than 10  active  electrodes  were  not  included  in  analysis.  Data  from  single electrodes  were  removed  post  hoc  in  spike  rate indicative  of  noise  on  that  channel  were  observed;  data  from only  4  electrodes  from  4  separate  wells  were  removed  for  this reason. if  changes The  MFR  was  ﬁrst  calculated  for  both  the  baseline  and  treated cases  for  each  electrode.  The  average  per  well  MFR  for  the  baseline and  the  treated  condition  were  determined  for  every  experiment. For  each  individual  chemical,  the  MFR  averages  for  each  well  was weighted  by  the  corresponding  total  number  of  active  electrodes using  EXCEL’s  SUMPRODUCT  function  and  then  averaged  across the  sum  of  those  electrodes.  The  resultant  weighted  mean  ﬁring rate  (wMFR)  averages  for  the  baseline  and  treated  cases  were  then compared  to  compute  a  percentage  change  in  the  treated  case 1 There  is  no  free  bisphenol  A  following  reaction  of  the  epoxy  as  it  is  not  present  in excess.  Cells  grown  in  mwMEA  plates  form  neuronal  networks  comparable  to  those grown  on  glass. relative  to  the  baseline  case.  Additionally,  a  simple  percentage change  in  the  total  number  of  active  treated  electrodes  relative  to the  total  number  of  active  baseline  electrodes  was  calculated  in order  to  capture  possible  changes  in  the  number  of  AEs. 2.6.  Propidium  iodide/Hoechst  staining  for  cytotoxicity The  30  chemicals  studied  were  tested  for  cytotoxicity  using  the ﬂuorescent,  vital  stain  propidium  iodide  (PI)  which  binds  to  DNA only  in  cells  with  a  compromised  plasma  membrane.  Using  the above  cell  culture  method,  96  well  plates  were  cultured  with  a density  of  40,000  cells/well.  At  DIV  13  or  14  chemicals  were  added (at  the  same  concentration  as  used  in  MEA  testing)  to  each  well  and incubated  at  37  8C  for  30  min.  Triton  X100  (1%  by  volume)  was included  on  one  well  of  each  plate  as  a  positive  control  to  induce cell  death,  and  each  plate  also  contained  wells  that  had  no chemicals  added  to  serve  as  negative  controls.  After  30  min,  media was  removed  and  100  mL  of  5  mM  PI  (Invitrogen)  in  Locke’s  buffer was  added  to  each  well  with  wide  oriﬁce  pipette  tips  that  reduced the  mechanical  disturbance  to  the  cultures.  Plates  were  incubated at  37  8C  for  another  20  min  before  aspirating  the  PI.  Then  100  mL  of warm  ﬁxative  containing  3  mg/mL  Hoechst  33342  was  added  to each  well  and  incubated  at  room  temperature  for  20  min.  Fixative was  aspirated  and  wells  were  washed  two  times  with  100  mL  Ca/ Mg-free  PBS  (Gibco)  leaving  the  ﬁnal  wash  in  the  wells.  Plates  were then  sealed  with  optical  plate  tape  and  stored  at  4  8C  until  images were  collected. Quantitative  ﬂuorescence  imaging  with  a  Cellomics  ArrayScan VTI (ThermoScientiﬁc,  Pittsburgh,  PA)  was  used  to  determine  the number  of  PI  positive  cells  in  each  well.  Fluorescence  images  were obtained  in  two  channels:  valid  cells  were  identiﬁed  using  Hoescht stain  (Hoescht  stains  DNA  in  all  cell  nuclei)  by  imaging  in  channel using  an  excitation  wavelength  of  365  (cid:6)  25  nm  and  an  emission wavelength  of  515  (cid:6)  10  nm.  PI  positive  cells  (PI  stains  DNA  only  in cells  with  compromised  plasma  membranes)  were  imaged  in  channel 2  using  an  excitation  wavelength  of  549  (cid:6)  4  nm  and  an  emission wavelength  of  600  (cid:6)  12  nm.  the Cellomics  Target  Activation  Bioapplication.  A  mask  was  created Images  were  analyzed  using E.R.  McConnell  et  al.  /  NeuroToxicology  33  (2012)  1048– around  all  Hoechst  stained  nuclei  in  channel  1  and  used  to  identify cells  in  channel  2.  Nuclei  in  channel  2  were  considered  positive  for  PI staining  when  the  average  ﬂuorescent  intensity  was  greater  than  3(cid:4) background.  The  percentage  of  PI  positive  cells  was  calculated  for each  well,  with  a  minimum  of  300  cells  counted/well.  Each  chemical was  applied  to  two  wells  in  two  different  cultures  (n  =  4).  Values  from the  four  trials  were  averaged  to  determine  cytotoxicity. 3.  Results 3.1.  Baseline  and  control  responses Because  multi-well  MEA  plates  are  a  new  technology,  prelimi- nary  experiments  were  conducted  to  characterize  the  develop- ment  of  network  activity  on  these  plates  in  comparison  to  single- well  MEAs.  The  ontogeny  of  activity,  both  in  terms  of  numbers  of active  electrodes  (AEs)  as  well  as  the  MFR  on  those  electrodes demonstrated  a  steady  pattern  of  increases  between  DIV  5  and  12, with  more  stable  activity  thereafter  (Fig.  2).  This  is  comparable  to previously  published  data  using  a  single-well  MEA  system (Robinette  et  al.,  2011).  Next,  a  concentration–response  curve was  determined  for  the  GABAA receptor  antagonist  BIC.  BIC induced  a  concentration-dependent  increase  in  MFR,  with  an  EC value  of  0.30  mM  (Fig.  3),  which  is  consistent  with  laboratory historical  values  of  0.41  mM  (unpublished  data)  for  this  compound. Over  the  course  of  the  experiments  with  the  chemical  training  set compounds  (see  Table  1),  a  total  of  158  wells  were  recorded  from 10  different  cortical  culture  preparations.  Averaged  over  all  of  the baseline  recordings,  there  were  27  (cid:6)  12.2  active  electrodes/well (mean  (cid:6)  s.d.,  n  =  158)  and  49  (cid:6)  27.3  spikes/min/well  (mean  (cid:6)  s.d., n  =  158).  BIC  (50  mM)  and  tetrodotoxin  (1  mM)  were  evaluated  as endpoint  selective  controls  (Crofton  et  al.,  2011)  that  increase  and decrease  activity,  respectively.  As  an  endpoint-selective  control compound,  BIC  increased  MFR  to  131  (cid:6)  13%  of  control  values (mean  (cid:6)  s.d.,  n  =  18).  However,  in  several  cases  (8),  the  overall network  response  to  BIC  was  either  no  net  change  or  a  decrease  in MFR.  This  is  consistent  with  previous  observations  in  our  laboratory as  well  as  previous  reports  of  heterogeneous  network  responses  to bicuculline  (Sokal  et  al.,  2000).  If  these  8  wells  are  removed,  then  the average  increase  in  MFR  was  165  (cid:6)  13  (n  =  10).  This  is  slightly  lower than  the  laboratory  historical  value  of  181%  for  BIC  plus  the  GABAB antagonist  SCH50911  (Meyer  et  al.,  2008).  By  contrast,  responses  to TTX  were  consistent,  with  activity  in  all  treated  wells  ceasing completely  within  1  min  after  application  of  this  toxin.  For  those wells  treated  with  DMSO,  an  overall  increase  22  (cid:6)  9.5%  (mean  (cid:6)  s.d., n  =  18)  in  unweighted  MFR  was  observed.  Neither  DMSO  nor  BIC  had a  signiﬁcant  effect  on  the  number  of  AEs,  whereas  by  default  there were  no  AEs  in  the  presence  of  TTX. 3.2.  Chemical  training  set  responses There  are  several  different  approaches  that  could  be  utilized  to determine  what  magnitude  of  a  change  in  activity  would  be considered  a  ‘‘hit’’  from  a  screening  context  and  thus  select  a chemical  for  additional  testing.  In  the  present  experiments,  each well  served  as  its  own  control,  and  the  change  in  activity  elicited  by a  treatment  can  be  easily  expressed  as  a  percent  of  that  control activity.  Changes  in  mean  ﬁring  rate  have  often  been  used  as  a metric  for  drug  and  chemical  induced  changes  in  network  activity (for  example:  Gramowski  et  al.,  2000;  Gopal,  2003;  Meyer  et  al., 2008;  Shafer  et  al.,  2008;  Novellino  et  al.,  2011).  However,  it  is necessary  to  account  for  the  potential  variability  seen  in  the number  of  AEs  which  can  incorrectly  value  the  MFR  between  and within  experiments.  To  account  for  differences  in  numbers  of active  electrodes  between  the  MFR  was weighted  for  both  the  control  and  treated  condition  based  on treatment  groups, Fig.  2.  Average  number  of  active  electrodes  (AE)/well  (bottom)  and  mean  ﬁring  rate (MFR)  on  active  electrodes  as  a  function  of  days  in  vitro  (DIV).  There  are  a  total  of potential  electrodes  in  each  well.  The  culture  date  is  considered  to  be  DIV  0.  On  the days  indicated,  10  min  of  activity  were  recorded  and  the  plate  was  returned  to  the incubator.  Data  are  the  means  (cid:6)  SEMs  of  12–29  wells  from  one  to  three  12  well  MEA plates.  Data  are  shown  for  up  to  15  DIV,  but  similar  results  were  obtained  from  plates through  DIV  22. the  number  of  active  electrodes.  The  mean  percent  change  in wMFR  induced  by  the  vehicle  control,  DMSO,  was  an  increase  of 12.2  (cid:6)  0.93%  (mean  (cid:6)  s.d.)  when  a  cross  validation  technique  was used  to  determine  the  standard  deviation  of  the  weighted  mean. Therefore,  the  detection  threshold  was  set  to  14%,  which  was  the mean  change  induced  by  DMSO  plus  two  standard  deviations  from this  mean,  regardless  of  the  direction  of  the  change.  Although weighting  normalizes  the  MFR  based  on  the  number  of  active electrodes,  the  wMFR  does  not  reﬂect  changes  in  the  number  of  active electrodes.  Thus,  changes  in  the  number  of  active  electrodes  were Fig.  3.  Concentration–response  relationship  for  bicuculline  effects  on  MFR  in cortical  networks.  A  cumulative  concentration  curve  was  constructed  by  increasing the  concentration  of  BIC  in  each  well  and  recording  for  10  min.  Values  shown  are  the means  (cid:6)  SEM  from  12  wells  on  a  single  plate.  Based  on  previous  concentration– response  characterizations,  higher  concentrations  of  BIC  (50  mM)  cause  similar increases  in  activity  (data  not  shown).

Chemicals  were  added  to  wells  between  DIV  14  and  DIV  22.  A chemical  was  considered  a  hit  if  the  average  percent  change  for  wMFR  was  greater  than  14%  (2(cid:4)  the  standard  deviation  from  the  mean  percent  change  of  wMFR  for  the DMSO),  or  if  the  number  of  AEs  was  changed  by  more  than  20%. b Due  to  limited  solubility,  these  chemicals  were  tested  at  10  mM. c Due  to  limited  solubility,  this  chemical  was  tested  at  30  mM. evaluated  as  a  second  criterion  for  a  hit.  DMSO  treatment  did  not change  the  number  of  active  electrodes.  To  provide  some  margin  for biological  variability,  a  20%  or  greater  change  in  the  number  of  AEs was  also  considered  a  hit. The  overall  number  of  AEs  and  wMFR  responses  for  the chemical  training  set  are  presented  in  Fig.  4  and  Table  2.  Using  the thresholds  established  above,  none  of  the  7  negative  chemicals reached  the  threshold  values  for  either  parameter.  Of  the positive  compounds,  20  caused  a  change  in  wMFR  that  exceeded the  threshold  value  of  14%.  Twelve  chemicals  caused  a  change  in the  number  of  AEs  that  exceeded  the  threshold  of  20%,  but  this  was a  subset  of  the  chemicals  that  were  detected  by  changes  in  wMFR. Changes  in  wMFR  included  both  increases  and  decreases  (Fig.  5, supplemental  Fig.  1),  indicating  that  the  MEAs  could  detect chemicals  that  altered  spontaneous  activity  in  either  direction. Overall,  11  chemicals  decreased  and  9  chemicals  increased  wMFR. Interestingly,  of  the  9  chemicals  that  increased  wMFR,  4  caused decreases  in  #AEs  that  reached  threshold  values.  The  three chemicals  that  were  expected  to  cause  changes  in  activity  but did  not  were  nicotine  (13.3%  change  in  wMFR),  imidacloprid  (0.3% change  in  wMFR),  and  bifenthrin  (5.2%  change  in  wMFR).  Thus, using  both  criteria,  none  of  the  negative  compounds  were  detected as  a  hit,  while  20  of  23  positive  compounds  were  considered  hits. Therefore,  cortical  neurons  grown  in  mwMEAs  have  a  sensitivity (correct  identiﬁcation  of  positives)  of  87%,  a  speciﬁcity  (correct identiﬁcation  of  negatives)  of  100%,  and  a  concordance  (correct identiﬁcation  of  all  chemicals)  of  90%. 3.3.  Conﬁrmation  of  results Results  for  six  chemicals  were  conﬁrmed  using  a  single-well MEA  system.  Sorbitol  (50  mM)  treatment  resulted  in  a  wMFR change  of  1.9%  (n  =  3),  nicotine  treatment  resulted  in  a  wMFR change  of  0.8%  (n  =  2),  and  imidacloprid  treatment  produced  a decrease  in  wMFR  by  6.7%  (n  =  2).  By  contrast,  both  verapamil  and domoic  acid  inhibited  wMFR  by  100%  (n  =  2)  and  ﬁpronil  treatment resulted  in  a  93.1%  decrease  in  wMFR  (n  =  2).  These  results  conﬁrm the  multiwell  results  that  sorbitol,  imidacloprid,  and  nicotine  had no  effect,  and  verapamil,  domoic  acid,  and  ﬁpronil  decreased  the wMFR  beyond  the  threshold  for  a  hit.  Concentration–response curves  were  generated  for  nicotine,  acetaminophen,  deltamethrin and  domoic  acid  in  a  single,  separate  experiment  (n  =  1).  The results  the  single concentration  screening  results  as  well  as  other  concentration– response  data  generated  in  the  lab  for  these  chemicals. (data  not  shown)  were  consistent  with 3.4.  Cytotoxicity  assay Incorporation  of  information  regarding  cell  viability  can  be informative  for  screening  assays  by  helping  to  determine  if  effects are  driven  by  cytotoxicity,  rather  than  more  speciﬁc  disruption  of cellular  processes.  The  majority  of  the  chemicals  in  the  training  set were  without  cytotoxic  effects  on  the  cortical  cultures  after  a 30  min  exposure  (Fig.  6).  Fluoxetine  (50  mM)  caused  the  most cytotoxicity  with  95  (cid:6)  5%  of  cells  staining  PI  positive  (mean  (cid:6)  s.d., E.R.  McConnell  et  al.  /  NeuroToxicology  33  (2012)  1048– Fig.  4.  Results  from  single  concentration  tests  at  50  mM  or  highest  soluble  concentration  for  chemical  training  set  showing  percent  change  (n  =  3–7,  except  bicuculline  (n  =  18) and  DMSO  (n  =  18))  in  both  weighted  mean  ﬁring  rate  (wMFR)  and  active  electrodes  (AEs).  Chemicals  were  applied  to  independent  wells  between  14  and  22  DIV  and  changes were  calculated  from  control  data  from  each  individual  well.  The  hit  detection  threshold  line  is  for  the  wMFR  and  represents  two  standard  deviations  from  the  mean  percent change  for  treatment  with  DMSO,  the  vehicle.  20  out  of  23  neuroactive  chemicals  were  detected  as  hits  while  all  7  negatives  did  not  pass  the  detection  threshold.  Bifenthrin, nicotine,  and  imidacloprid  were  false  negatives.  Domoic  acid,  methylmercury,  and  trimethyltin  were  tested  at  10  mM,  and  lead  was  tested  at  30  mM. Fig.  5.  Examples  of  training  set  chemicals  that  decrease  (Left,  ﬁpronil)  and  increase  (Right,  permethrin)  MFR  in  MEAs.  An  example  experiment  illustrates  the  average  ﬁring rate/min  of  the  active  electrodes  in  one  well  of  a  mwMEA  plate.  The  ﬁrst  30  min  illustrates  baseline  activity  in  the  absence  of  any  treatment,  while  31–60  min  illustrate activity  in  the  presence  of  permethrin  and  ﬁpronil.  These  examples  were  constructed  by  combining  two  separate  ﬁles,  saved  in  the  absence  and  presence  of  treatment, respectively,  and  the  ﬁrst  3  min  of  each  of  these  ﬁles  were  removed  as  described  in  Section  2.  In  supplemental  Fig.  1,  raster  plots  are  provided  for  each  point  labeled  by  the arrows  (a  and  b),  showing  activity  before  and  after  the  addition  of  chemical. n  =  4).  Cytotoxicity  has  been  reported  in  glioma  and  human neuroblastoma  cells  following  a  24  hr  exposure  to  ﬂuoxetine  at similar  concentrations  (Levkovitz  et  al.,  2005).  Fipronil  (50  mM)  also consistently  caused  some  cytotoxicity,  with  34.1  (cid:6)  8.2%  of  cells staining  positive  for  PI  (mean  (cid:6)  s.d.,  n  =  4).  Both  methylmercury  and lindane  also  caused  some  cytotoxicity,  as  13.1  (cid:6)  10.7%  and 47.1  (cid:6)  40.0%  of  cells  stained  positive  for  PI,  respectively  (n  =  4). 4.  Discussion The  present  experiments  demonstrate that  spontaneous activity  in  cortical  neurons  grown  on  mwMEA  plates  have  an ontogeny  and  pharmacological  sensitivity  similar  to  that  observed on  single-well  MEAs.  Furthermore,  as  demonstrated  here, mwMEAs  can  provide  a  rapid  and  robust  method  of  screening compounds  for  potential  neuroactivity.  Under  the  thresholds selected  for  identiﬁcation  of  a  hit,  only  three  of  twenty-three compounds  expected  to  alter  activity  were  not  identiﬁed  as  hits (false  negatives),  and  none  of  the  seven  compounds  expected  not to  alter  activity  were  incorrectly  identiﬁed  as  hits  (false  positives). Only  four  compounds  caused  measurable  cytotoxicity,  indicating that  for  most  of  the  compounds  tested,  activity  was  selectively affected  during  the  exposure.  Thus,  this  assay  has  a  sensitivity, speciﬁcity,  and  concordance  of  87,  100  and  90%,  respectively.  These results  indicate  that  a  single  concentration  screening  approach  can be  used  to  detect  chemicals  with  the  potential  to  alter  neuronal function;  such  ‘‘hits’’  could  then  be  conﬁrmed  with  concentration– response  assessments.  Using  such  an  approach  in  mwMEA  plates can  signiﬁcantly  increase  the  throughput  of  MEAs  for  neurotoxicity testing.

trimethyltin,  methylmercury).  Seven  compounds  were  selected as  negative  controls;  two  of  which  (paraquat  and  salicylic  acid)  had been  previously  reported  not  to  alter  network  activity  (Defranchi et  al.,  2011)  and  ﬁve  of  which  previously  had  been  used  as  negative controls  for  developmental  neurotoxicity  assays  (Breier  et  al., 2008;  Radio  et  al.,  2008). MEAs  provide  high-content  data  in  the  form  of  spatial  and temporal  information  regarding  spontaneous  network  spiking  and bursting  activity.  Thus,  a  number  of  metrics  could  have  been considered  in  the  decision  to  label  a  compound  as  a  hit.  However, in  the  context  of  screening  large  numbers  of  compounds,  it  is important  to  have  a  simple  and  rapid  metric  for  hit  selection.  In  the present  study,  two  parameters  were  utilized  to  determine  whether or  not  a  compound  was  considered  a  hit  in  the  assay:  a  >20% change  in  the  number  of  AEs  or  a  change  in  wMFR  of  2  standard deviations  beyond  the  mean  change  caused  by  the  vehicle  (DMSO). Both  of  these  metrics  can  be  quickly  extracted  from  the  raw  data. The  wMFR  was  clearly  a  more  sensitive  endpoint,  as  all  20  of  the compounds  considered  hits  altered  this  value,  consistent  with  the widespread  use  of  MFR  in  previous  studies  (for  review,  see Johnstone  et  al.,  2010).  When  assaying  large  numbers  of compounds,  weighting  the  MFR  by  the  number  of  AEs,  as  was done  in  the  present  studies,  increases  comparability  across  wells. Twelve  compounds  changed  the  number  of  AEs,  but  no  compound changed  only  the  number  of  AEs.  Diazepam  effects  exceeded  the threshold  for  wMFR  by  only  a  small  amount  ((cid:2)18.6%  change),  but they  also  clearly  exceeded  the  threshold  value  for  number  of  AEs ((cid:2)80%  change).  Because  diazepam  usually  but  not  in  every  case, decreased  activity  to  cessation,  the  change  in  MFR  weighted against  number  of  AEs  is  skewed.  Thus,  in  cases  like  diazepam,  it  is useful  to  also  consider  the  number  of  AEs  as  a  metric  to  detect  a  hit. For  most  of  the  compounds  in  the  training  set,  the  changes  in activity  were  not  associated  with  changes  in  cell  viability,  as  only four  compounds  caused  viability  changes.  Fluoxetine  caused  (cid:3)95% of  the  cells  to  be  PI  positive  in  the  30  min  test  period,  while  ﬁpronil, lindane  and  methylmercury  caused  measurable,  but  not  complete cytotoxicity.  It  is  more  difﬁcult  to  determine  the  contribution  of this  cytotoxicity  to  the  changes  in  activity  observed  with  these compounds.  While  the  PI  assay  does  provide  information  about non-viable  cells  in  the  network,  without  additional  counter- staining  for  neurons  and  glia,  it  is  not  possible  to  determine whether  the  cytotoxicity  is  occurring  evenly  across  these  two different  cell  types  or  if  one  is  more  vulnerable  than  the  other. However,  toxicity  to  either  neurons  or  glia  could  inﬂuence  activity, the  former  by  direct  effects  (loss  of  ﬁring  neurons)  and  the  latter  by indirect  effects  (loss  of  glial  support).  In  the  context  of  screening large  chemical  sets,  follow  up  of  hits  with  characterization  of  the concentration–response  for  effects  on  activity  as  well  as  cell viability  will  be  able  to  provide  information  regarding  the speciﬁcity  for  effects  on  activity. If  a  large  set  of  compounds  were  being  screened  using  this assay,  identiﬁed  hits  would  be  conﬁrmed  either  by  conducting  a concentration–response  curve  or  by  testing  the  compound  in  a ‘‘2nd  tier’’  assay.  In  addition,  it  is  recognized  that  simply  assessing changes  in  the  wMFR  and  #AEs  with  MEAs  does  not  provide information  regarding  mechanism  of  action.  Thus,  hit  characteri- zation  could  also  include  more  detailed  examination  of  other parameters  of  activity  (bursting,  synchrony  burst  structure,  etc.). Application  of  approaches  such  as  spike  train  analysis  (Brown  et  al., 2004)  and  features  selection  (Schroeder  et  al.,  2008)  might  also allow  sorting  of  hits  into  different  pharmacological  classes  (for review,  see  the  majority  of compounds  in  this  training  set  have  already  been  evaluated  in MEAs,  conﬁrmation  of  the  present  results  was  limited  to  a  subset  of positive  and  negative  compounds  in  a  single-well  system  using  a different  MEA  platform.

Cells  were treated  for  30  min  with  the  chemical  and  stained  with  propidium  iodide  and Hoechst.  Quantitative  ﬂuorescence  imaging  was  used  to  determine  the  percent  of total  non-viable  cells  (e.g.  propidium  iodide  positive).  Some  cytotoxicity  was observed  and methylmercury.  Valproic  acid  was  not  tested  due  to  limited  quantities  of  stock solution.  Values  are  the  means  (cid:6)  SEMs  for  4  observations  in  two  separate  cultures.

In  the  present  experiments, the  ontogeny  of  spontaneous  activity  was  consistent  with  previous results  (Robinette  et  al.,  2011),  as  was  the  pharmacology.  TTX, which  blocks  voltage-gated  sodium  channels,  blocked  all  activity. Bicuculline-induced  increases  in  activity  occurred  with  an  EC value  similar  to  that  which  had  been  historically  observed  in  the laboratory.  In  some  cases,  BIC  did  not  result  in  overall  increases  in network  activity.  This  has  been  observed  laboratory (unpublished  data)  and  heterogeneous  responses  in  other  labora- tories  have  also  been  reported  (Sokal  et  al.,  2000).  Together  with the  previous  characterizations  of  spontaneous  activity  in  cortical networks,  these  results  indicate  that  many  aspects  of  network development  and  pharmacology  are  intrinsic  to  neuronal  net- works,  and  develop  independently  from  the  MEA  platform. in  our The  current  study  utilized  concepts  for  assay  development  that were  outlined  by  Crofton  et  al.  (2010).  Speciﬁcally,  TTX  and  BIC were  evaluated  as  assay-speciﬁc  control  compounds  based  on  their known  mechanisms  of  action.  The  network  response  to  TTX  was  a consistent  loss  of  network  spiking  activity,  indicating  that  this compound  is  a  good  in-plate  control  for  inhibition  of  activity.  By contrast,  responses  to  BIC  were  not  consistent,  even  though  the overall  net  effect  of  this  compound  was  to  increase  activity  and  it was  detected  as  a  ‘‘hit’’  by  the  criteria  used  for  these  studies. However,  by  making  some  minor  alterations  in  the  tissue  culture methods  (addition  of  a  step  ﬁltering  cells  prior  to  plating), increases  in  MFR  following  BIC  (25  mM)  are  more  consistent  (53/ wells  increased  MFR;  unpublished  data).  As  such,  evaluation  of  BIC as  an  in-plate  control  that  increases  MFR  is  ongoing. To  evaluate  the  ability  of  mwMEAs  to  screen  for  effects  on neuronal  network  function,  a  training  set  of  23  compounds  was selected  and  tested  at  a  single  concentration.  The  training  set tested  the  ability  of  mwMEAs  to  detect  alterations  mediated  by  a wide  variety  of  pharmacological  and  toxicological  actions,  and included  compounds  that  were  agonists  or  antagonists  at GABAergic,  glutamatergic,  and  nicotinic  cholinergic  receptors, voltage-gated  sodium  channels  (pyrethroids)  and  acetylcholines- terase  (chlorpyrifos  oxon,  carbamate),  as  well  as  other  neuroactive/ toxic  compounds  that  are  lead, less  speciﬁc  (valproic  acid, E.R.  McConnell  et  al.  /  NeuroToxicology  33  (2012)  1048– (sorbitol  and  nicotine)  did  not  alter  wMFR,  while  the  three compounds  that  were  hits  (ﬁpronil,  domoic  acid,  verapamil)  all changed  wMFR  by  more  than  90%.  Of  the  30  compounds  in  the present  study,  16  of  them  have  been  tested  in  other  laboratories using  various  MEA  systems;  for  14  of  those  16  compounds,  the results  of  the  present  study  are  consistent  with  the  previous  data from  other  laboratories;  this  includes  not  only  detecting  the ability  of  a  chemical  to  cause  a  change,  but  also  the  direction  of that  change  (e.g.  increase  or  decrease  in  spontaneous  activity).  The two  compounds  from  this  group  that  did  not  replicate  were nicotine  which  was  without  effect  in  the  present  study,  and valproic  acid,  which  increased  activity  above  threshold,  rather than  decreasing  it  (Gross  et  al.,  1995).  However,  the  concentra- tions  of  valproate  reported  to  decrease  activity  were  300–700  mM (Gross  et  al.,  1995),  much  higher  than  tested  in  the  present studies.  These  data  indicate  that  assessment  of  drug  and  chemical effects  on  neuronal  network  function  is  a  robust  approach  that  is reproducible  across  laboratories  and  platforms  and  is  consistent with  a  previous  study  focused  on  reproducibility  of  MEA  results (Novellino  et  al.,  2011). The  lack  of  nicotine  effect  was  conﬁrmed  in  the  present  study by  testing  it  at  a  single  concentration  of  50  mM  in  another  system, as  well  as  testing  the  concentration–response  to  nicotine.  Although the  latter  was  only  a  single  replication,  it  is  in  agreement  with other  unpublished  data  from  this  laboratory  wherein  nicotine concentrations  up  to  500  mM  cause  only  a  (cid:3)15–20%  change  in ﬁring  rates  (unpublished  data).  Nicotine  was  identiﬁed  as  a neuroactive  substance  in  MEAs  by  Defranchi  et  al.  (2011)  with increases  in  MFR  in  their  study  observed  at  100  mM  nicotine.  Thus, the  lack  of  effect  of  nicotine  in  the  present  study  may  be  due  to  the concentration  being  too  low  to  elicit  an  effect.  However,  the efﬁcacy  of  nicotine  on  neuronal  nicotinic  acetylcholine  receptors  in primary  hippocampal  cultures  is  in  the  range  of  (cid:3)10–25  mM (Alkondon  and  Albuquerque,  1993),  much  the concentrations  used  in  either  MEA  study.  The  effects  reported by  Defranchi  and  co-workers  may  not  have  been  mediated  by nAChR,  which  was  not  tested  in  that  study.  Alternatively,  it  is possible  that  the  culture  model  used  here  is  not  responsive  to nicotinic  modulation,  and  the  lack  of  response  to  nicotine  in  the present  study  reﬂects  this.  Imidacloprid  has  a  lower  afﬁnity  for some  subtypes  of  nAChR  than  nicotine  (Tomizawa  and  Casida, 2005)  and  can  function  under  some  conditions  as  a  partial  agonist (Nagata  et  al.,  1998).  Given  the  lack  of  response  to  nicotine  in  the present  study,  it  is  not  surprising  that  imidacloprid  did  not  alter network  activity. lower than Compared  to  the  two  nicotinic  agonists,  it  is  interesting  that two  cholinesterase  inhibiting  insecticides,  chlorpyrifos  oxon  and carbaryl,  caused  clear  effects  in  the  present  study.  Carbaryl  also produced  complete  inhibition  of  MFR  in  studies  by  Defranchi  and colleagues.  These  results  are  consistent  with  previous  reports  of alterations  in  spontaneous  activity  of  neural  networks  by cholinesterase  inhibitors  (Keefer  et  al.,  2001).  The  lack  of  response to  nicotine  indicates  that  effects  of  cholinesterase  inhibitors  in  the present  study  were  not  due  to  direct  activation  of  nAChR  or  to activation  secondary  inhibition.  One possible  mechanism  that  may  account  for  the  effects  of  chlorpyri- fos  oxon  and  carbaryl  is  that  they  were  mediated  by  muscarinic AChR  secondary  to  inhibition  of  acetylcholinesterase.  Carbachol, acting  through  muscarinic  ACh  receptors,  has  been  reported  to alter  neuronal  activity  in  MEAs  (Tateno  et  al.,  2005).  Acetylcholin- esterase-independent  actions  have  been  reported  these compounds,  especially  for  chlorpyrifos  oxon  (for  reviews,  see Pope,  1999;  Slotkin,  2004),  including  direct  actions  on  muscarinic AChR,  as  well  as  other  targets.  Thus,  an  alternative  explanation  for the  current  results  with  these  two  compounds  is  that  their  effects were  mediated  via  direct  interaction  with  muscarinic  AChR  or to  acetylcholinesterase for other  non-cholinergic  actions.  Further  study  of  the  responsiveness of  this  culture  model  to  cholinergic  compounds,  including  agonists and  antagonists  of  both  nicotinic  and  muscarinic  receptors,  as  well as  characterization  of  the  expression  of  cholinergic  receptors,  will help  to  clarify  its  utility  to  detect  compounds  that  act  via cholinergic  pathways. than the  hit thresholds.  Two  of The  third  compound  that  was  not  detected  as  a  hit  was bifenthrin.  Bifenthrin  is  a  type  I  pyrethroid  insecticide,  which  act via  disruption  of  voltage-gated  sodium  channel  gating  kinetics  (for review,  see  Soderlund  et  al.,  2002).  Three  other  pyrethroid compounds  included  in  this  study  all  caused  effects  that  were greater  these  compounds (cyﬂuthrin  and  deltamethrin)  are  type  II  pyrethroids,  which produce  longer  lasting  modiﬁcations  of  sodium  channel  gating than  do  type  I  compound I  compounds.  However,  the  type  permethrin  also  had  effects  in  the  present  studies,  so  it  is  unclear why  bifenthrin  was  without  effect.  In  a  recent  study  examining sodium  and  calcium  ﬂux  in  mouse  cortical  neurons,  bifenthrin  had low  efﬁcacy  in  modulation  of  both  responses  (Cao  et  al.,  2011a,b). This  lack  of  efﬁcacy  may  underlie  the  response  in  the  present study.  However,  under  conditions  where  inhibitory  GABAergic neurotransmission  is  blocked,  bifenthrin  reduced  network  ﬁring rate  in  a  concentration-dependent  manner  and  has  an  IC50 value  in the  nM  range  (Losa  et  al.,  2009;  manuscript  in  preparation).  Thus, bifenthrin  could  be  considered  a  false  negative  in  the  current study. The  need  for  in  vitro  assays  to  screen  chemicals  for  their  hazard potential  is  well  recognized  (NRC,  2007;  Bal-Price  et  al.,  2008; Andersen  and  Krewski,  2009;  Boekelheide  and  Campion,  2010). The  nervous  system  presents  unique  challenges  with  respect  to screening  assays  because  its  functional  output  involves  spatial and  temporal  patterns  of  electrical  activity  that  are  inﬂuenced  by the  phenotypes  of  various  cells  that  comprise  different  neuronal pathways.  For  in  vitro  assays  based  on  biochemical  and morphological  endpoints,  it  is  often  difﬁcult  or  not  possible  to predict  how  changes  in  these  endpoints  may  ultimately  inﬂuence neuronal  function.  In  addition,  there  are  many  different  known toxicity  pathways  in  the  nervous  system  that  will  result  in signiﬁcant,  and  sometimes  fatal,  toxicity  outcomes  prior  to  or  in the  absence  of  changes  in  protein  levels  or  gene  expression. Neurophysiology  has  been  utilized  for  many  decades  as  a  sensitive indicator  of  chemical  neurotoxicity.  However,  many  neurophysi- ological  approaches  lack  the  throughput  necessary  to  be  efﬁcient screens  for  neuroactivity/toxicity.  MEAs  have  been  proposed  as  a viable  approach  for  screening  that  has  the  ability  to  detect changes  caused  by  many  different  classes  of  compounds (Johnstone  et  al.,  2010;  Novellino  et  al.,  2011).  However,  single well  MEA  platforms  widely  utilized  limited throughput  capability  and  thus  are  an  inefﬁcient  approach  for assaying  large  numbers  of  chemicals.  The  mwMEA  plates  utilized in  the  present  experiments  offer  a  signiﬁcant  increase  in  capacity for  measurement  of  compound-induced  alterations  in  neuronal network  function.  Furthermore,  the  design  of  the  multi-well  plate in  compliance  with  ANSI  speciﬁcations  for  multi-well  tissue culture  plates  will  increasing facilitate  automation,  throughput.  Future  advancements,  such  as  expected  48  and well  mwMEA  plates,  will  result  in  higher  throughput  and  offer  the potential  to  develop  neurotoxicity  screening  assays  capable  of screening  greater  numbers  of  chemicals. to  date  have further Conﬂict  of  interest Emma  R.
