In a primary culture of rat cortical neurons, deltamethrin (DM), a type II pyrethroid, markedly enhanced the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) exon IV-IX (Bdnf eIV-IX) mRNA. In this study, we found that DM has a neurotrophic effect on cultured neurons and investigated the mechanisms responsible for it. One mM DM increased cell survival, neurite complexity and length. Neurite complexity and length were reduced not only by a blockade of cellular excitation with GABA or Ca2þ inﬂux via L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels with nicardipine, but also by a blockade of TrkB, a speciﬁc receptor for BDNF, with TrkB/Fc. These data indicate DM has neurotrophic actions. DM-induced Bdnf eIV-IX mRNA expression through the calcineurin and ERK/MAPK pathways, the increase of which was reduced by GABAA receptor activation. Using a promoter assay, we found that Ca2þ -responsive elements including a CRE are involved in the DM-induced activation of the Bdnf promoter IV (Bdnf-pIV). The intracellular concentration of Ca2þ and activation of Bdnf-pIV remained elevated for, at least, 1 and 24 h, respectively. Moreover, GABAA receptor activation or a blockade of Ca2þ inﬂux even after starting the incubation with DM reduced the elevated activity of Bdnf-pIV. These data demonstrated that the prolonged activation of Bdnf-pIV occurred because of this continuous increase in the intracellular Ca2þ concentration. Thus, DM has neurotrophic effects on neurons, likely due to prolonged activation of Bdnf promoter in neurons. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled ‘Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder’.

Introduction Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophin with important roles in controlling neuronal development, survival, and plasticity. Much evidence has recently emerged that BDNF affects dendritic structures (Gorski et al., 2003), which are thought to be essential to synaptic plasticity. In addition, the level of BDNF expression in the brain changes in patients with neuro- degenerative disorders including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and Huntington’s disease or psychiatric disorders including depression and schizophrenia (Angelucci et al., 2005; Zuccato and Cattaneo, 2007; Mattson, 2008). Thus, it seems highly possible that the expression of BDNF in the brain plays a fundamental role in * Corresponding author.

The BDNF gene (Bdnf) consists of eight 50 exons (exons I w VIII) and a common 30 exon (exon IX), encoding a preproBDNF protein (Aid et al., 2007). Nine promoters, Bdnf promoter I w IX (Bdnf- pI w pIX), were mapped upstream of the exons, each of which is controlled differently in the brain (Timmusk et al., 1993; Aid et al., 2007; Pruunsild et al., 2011). The Bdnf transcript containing exon IV (Bdnf eIV-IX) is the most abundant and widely detected in the rat brain (Metsis et al., 1993; Aid et al., 2007). A series of analyses have already demonstrated that the promoters of Bdnf-pI and pIV are activated by the inﬂux of Ca2þ into neurons through L-type voltage- dependent Ca2þ channel (L-VDCC), which can be caused by membrane depolarization with high concentrations of KCl in culture (Tao et al., 1998, 2002; Tabuchi et al., 2000, 2002; Chen et al., 2003). The Ca2þ signals evoked via L-VDCC consequently activate Bdnf-pI and -pIV through Ca2þ signal-responsive cis- elements including a cAMP-response element (CRE) which binds the CRE-binding protein (CREB). D. Ihara et al. / Neuropharmacology 62 (2012) 1091e Pyrethroids are highly active synthetic derivatives of natural pyrethrins which are toxins found in the ﬂowers of Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium. Since pyrethroids are rapidly metabolized in mammals and have low toxicity, they have been widely used to control insect pests in agriculture and in the home. Pyrethroid insecticides are classiﬁed into two major groups on the basis of chemical structure (Miyamoto et al., 1995): type II pyrethroids with a cyano moiety at the a-position (i.e., cypermethrin and delta- methrin), and type I pyrethroids, like permethrin, without it. Pyrethroids prolong the opening of the voltage-sensitive sodium channel (VSSC) and raise a prolonged sodium tail current in mammalian as well as invertebrate neurons (Vijverberg et al., 1982; Narahashi, 1985). Previously, we found that the administration of deltamethrin (DM), a type II pyrethroid, to cultured rat cortical neurons markedly increased Bdnf eIV-IX mRNA expression, to more than 100 times the control level through the Ca2þ signals evoked via L-VDCC (Imamura et al., 2006). In this study, we investigated whether or not the neurotrophin-like effects on cell survival and morphological changes are induced by DM and, if so, by what mechanisms these neurotrophic effects are induced. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Chemicals Technical-grade deltamethrin (DM), (S)-a-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl-(1R,3R)-3- (2,2-dibromovinyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate, was purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals (Tokyo, Japan). A stock solution of pyrethroids was prepared with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). APV, nicardipine, Bay K8644, FK506, GABA, muscimol and baclofen were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. TrkB/Fc was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). BAPTA-AM and U0126 were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). These chemicals were used to clarify the signaling pathways induced by DM. The concentrations of the drugs used in this study were determined by results obtained previously (Tabuchi et al., 2000; Imamura et al., 2006; Yasuda et al., 2007). 2.2. Primary culture of rat cortical neurons A primary culture of cortical cells was prepared from the cerebral cortexes of 17- day-old SpragueeDawley rat embryos (Japan SLC, Hamamatsu, Japan) as described previously (Imamura et al., 2006). The cells were suspended in DMEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin. For the mRNA analysis, reporter assays, and MTT assays, the dissociated cells were seeded at 2.5 (cid:2) 106 cells in 35 mm culture dishes (Iwaki, Tokyo, Japan) that had been coated with 0.1% polyethylenimine (SigmaeAldrich). Under such conditions, Kato-Negishi et al. (2004) have demon- strated that spontaneous Ca2þ oscillations can be synchronously induced among neurons, indicating that active synapses are formed in this culture. For immuno- staining, cells were plated at 7.0 (cid:2) 105 cells/well onto 18 mm coverslips. The coverslips were placed in 12-well plates (Iwaki) and coated with poly-D-lysine (SigmaeAldrich). The cells were grown for 3 days, and then the medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM containing 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin. For the intracellular Ca2þ imaging, the cells were seeded at a density of 1.2 (cid:2) 106 cells in 35 mm glass-based dishes (Iwaki) coated with poly-L-lysine (SigmaeAldrich), and thereafter incubated in neurobasal medium containing 2% B-27 supplement (Invitrogen), 2 mM L-glutamine, and 2 mg/ mL gentamycin for 3 days, after which half of the medium was changed. 2.3. MTT assay The MTT assay, in which the conversion of MTT to colored formazan is measured, was performed according to the method of Hansen et al. (1989). After stimulation for the period indicated, 300 mL of a 5 mg/mL MTT solution was added to 2 mL of the culture medium and the cells were incubated in a CO2 incubator for 1 h. Then, 1 mL of the culture medium was discarded, and 500 mL of extraction buffer (20% SDS and 50% dimethylformamide) was added. Cells were incubated overnight at 37 (cid:3)C before optical density (OD) was measured at 570 nm. 2.4. Immunostaining and morphological analysis The procedure was performed as described previously (Ishikawa et al., 2010). To monitor the effect of DM on the morphology of cortical neurons, a green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP) expression vector (1 mg/well) was transfected at 4 days in culture using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. At 6 days in culture, after treatment with the drugs for 6 h, cells were ﬁxed by placing them in PBS containing 4% formaldehyde and 4% sucrose for 15 min and then permeabilized by placing them in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100, 3% bovine serum albumin, and 3% normal goat serum for 1 h. The cells were incubated with anti-GFP and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) primary antibodies in the presence of blocking solution (PBS with 3% BSA and 3% normal goat serum) at 4 (cid:3)C overnight. After being washed in PBS, the cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with Alexa488- and Alexa594-conjugated secondary antibodies against rabbit or mouse IgG diluted in blocking solution. After another wash, nuclei were counter-stained with 300 nM 40,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Invitrogen). Finally, coverslips were moun- ted with Fluoromount (Diagnostic BioSystems, Pleasanton, CA). The rabbit poly- clonal antibodies used were anti-GFP (1:500; Invitrogen) and Alexa 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000, Invitrogen). The mouse monoclonal antibodies used were anti-MAP2 (1:1000, Sigma) and Alexa594-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:1000, Invitrogen). After immunostaining, the cells were processed for microscopy (BX50-34-FLA-1, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), as described previously (Sholl analysis, Ishikawa et al., 2010). A series of concentric circles at 20-mm intervals were centered on the cell body and the number of intersections with GFP-positive processes was recorded as an index of neurite complexity (Sholl, 1953). The length of neurites was measured by tracing all of the neurites starting at the cell body and extending within a circle of 400-mm diameter using Image J software. More than 120 neurons were totally evaluated from three independent experiments (n ¼ 3). We conﬁrmed that the GFP- positive cells used for the morphological analysis were MAP2-positive cells (Fig. S1). Namely, we observed all kinds of neurons without any selection of cells for measurements. 2.5. RNA isolation and quantitative RT-PCR analysis Total cellular RNA was extracted by the acid guanidine phenolechloroform method. The isolation of RNA from cultured cells or rat tissues was described in detail previously (Fukuchi et al., 2009). In brief, total cellular RNA was extracted using TRIsure (BIOLINE, London, UK) and treated with RNase-free DNase I (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan) to prevent contamination by genomic DNA. After the removal of DNase I, total RNA was quantiﬁed with a NanoDrop 1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Wil- mington, DE). One microgram of RNA was used for reverse transcription with SuperScript II (Invitrogen). Then quantitative PCR was performed using the Stra- tagene Mx3000p Real-Time PCR system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) in 20 mL of a reaction mixture containing 1 (cid:2) SYBR Green QPCR master mix (Stratagene), 2 mL of cDNA solution, and 0.2 mM of primer pairs. The thermal proﬁle for real-time PCR was as follows: initial denaturation at 95 (cid:3)C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of dena- turation at 95 (cid:3)C for 45 s, annealing at 57 (cid:3)C (dependent on Tm (cid:3)C of primers) for 45 s, and extension at 72 (cid:3)C for 1 min. Standard curves were generated for each gene using a plasmid DNA dilution series containing the target sequences. For the ampliﬁcation of rat Bdnf eIV-IX cDNA, Bdnf eIV sense (50-TCGGCCACCAAAGACTCG-30) and eIX antisense (50-GCCCATTCACGCTCTCCA-30) primers were used. For the internal control, Gapdh cDNA was ampliﬁed using rat Gapdh sense (50-ATCGTG- GAAGGGCTCATGAC-30) and antisense (50-TAGCCCAGGATGCCCTTTAGT-30) primers. The mRNA levels were computed from the threshold cycle (Ct) value and normalized to the concentration of Gapdh mRNA. 2.6. DNA transfection and luciferase assay DNA transfection was carried out over four days in culture. A plasmid DNA containing Bdnf-pIV was prepared to generate pGL4.12-Bdnf-pIV by inserting the ampliﬁed DNA fragments covering the region ((cid:4)629 to þ281) of Bdnf-pIV into the HindIII site of the pGL4.12-Basic ﬁreﬂy luciferase reporter vector (Promega, Madison, WI). As an internal control vector, phRL-TK((cid:4)) was purchased from Promega. Plasmid DNA was transfected using the calcium phosphate/DNA precipitation method as described previously (Imamura et al., 2006). In brief, the precipitates were prepared by mixing 1 volume (67 mL) of plasmid DNA (5.3 mg; pGL4.12-Bdnf- pIV:phRL-TK((cid:4)) ¼ 10:1) in a 250 mM CaCl2 solution with an equal volume of 2 (cid:2) HEPES-buffered saline, and added to a 35-mm dish. The dish was washed two times with PBS and replenished with fresh serum-free DMEM. After 2 days, the transfected cells were stimulated for 6 h, and cell lysates were extracted with passive lysis buffer (Promega). Dual (ﬁreﬂy and Renilla) luciferase activity was measured using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter assay system (Promega) with a TD-20/20 lumin- ometer (Promega). 2.7. Intracellular Ca2þ imaging The cells were incubated with 10 mM fura-2 acetoxymethylester (fura-2 AM) in neurobasal medium for 30 min at 37 (cid:3)C. They were then washed with balanced salt solution (150 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1.2 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM D-glucose and 25 mM HEPES; pH 7.4) and mounted on an inverted ﬂuorescence microscope (U7795-13, Hamamatsu Photonics). Digital images of fura-2 ﬂuorescence, recorded by a high-sensitivity CCD camera (C9100-13, Hamamatsu Photonics) for 4 min at image processor (AQUACOSMOS, 0.5 s intervals were analyzed by a digital

Hamamatsu Photonics). The ratio of 510 nm emission ﬂuorescence at 340 nm excitation to that at 380 nm excitation, termed “Ratio (F340/380)” was used as an indicator of the intracellular concentration of Ca2þ ]i) in single cells. ([Ca2þ 2.8. Statistics All data were expressed as the mean (cid:5) S.E.M. for a number of separate exper- iments performed, as indicated in the corresponding ﬁgures. Statistical analyses were performed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the TukeyeK- ramer or Sheffe’s F test, or repeated measure ANOVA with the Bonferroni/Dunn test (See Figure legends). 3. Results 3.1. Effect of DM on the survival of cortical neurons in culture Pyrethroid insecticides prolong the opening of the voltage- sensitive sodium channel (VSSC), giving rise to a sodium tail current in both insects and mammals (Soderlund et al., 2002). Previously, we demonstrated that Bdnf eIV-IX mRNA expression increased 3 h after incubation with 10 nM to 10 mM DM. Expression peaked with 1 mM DM with the level being about 150 times higher than that of the control (Imamura et al., 2006). To detect the neu- rotrophic action of DM on neurons, we ﬁrst examined the effect of DM on cell survival in culture. We incubated the cortical neurons with 0.1, 1 or 10 mM DM for 12 or 24 h and measured cell survival using a MTT assay. As shown in Fig. 1, the viability of the neurons was increased by the incubation with 0.1 or 1 mM but not 10 mM at 12 and 24 h compared to the control. Using DAPI staining, we also checked for changes in nuclear morphology characteristic of apoptosis at 1 mM DM but did not detect any evidence of condensed nuclei, an indicator for apoptosis (Fig. S1). 3.2. Morphological changes of neurons induced by DM To further detect the neurotrophic action of DM, we next examined the effect of DM on the morphology of neurons. For this purpose, we cultured the cells with 1 mM DM for 6 h after intro- ducing the GFP expression vector at 4 DIV and incubating the cells for another 2 days, and then processed the cultures for the ﬂuo- rescence microscopic observation of GFP-positive cells. Using im- munostaining with anti-MAP2 antibody, we focused on GFP- positive and MAP2-positive cells, including all types of neurons in culture (Fig. S1). The administration of DM increased changes in neurite structures (Fig. 2). To quantify the structural changes, we performed a Sholl analysis (Sholl, 1953; Ishikawa et al., 2010), enabling us to detect changes in neurite complexity by measuring the number of crossings between neurites and circles with different diameters. As shown in Fig. 2A, B, and C, addition of DM increased the number of crossings in cultures harvested 6 h after the incu- bation, indicating that DM promotes neurite complexity. We also measured total length of neurites using Image J software and found that DM increased the length of neurites (Fig. 2D). Since DM increases neuronal excitability through its effect on VSSC that depolarizes the membrane and subsequently openings of L-VDCC that cause the inﬂux of Ca2þ into neurons, we examined the effect of blockade of Ca2þ inﬂux via L-VDCC or activation of GABA receptors on the DM-induced increase in neurite complexity and length. As shown in Fig. 2A, B, and D, the DM-induced stimulation of neurite complexity and length was effectively reduced in the presence of 5 mM nicardipine, a blocker of L-VDCC. Upon treatment of cells with 100 mM GABA, the DM-induced increase in neurite complexity (at 20, 60, 80, 100, 120, and 140 mm from cell body) was reduced, and the length of neurites not changed compared to the control (Fig. 2A, C and D). Furthermore, addition of 100 ng/mL TrkB/ Fc, a blocker for the interaction of BDNF with TrkB receptors, effectively reduced the DM-induced change in neurite complexity and length (Fig. 2E, F, and G). Addition of GABA tended to increase the neurite complexity and length (Fig. 2A, C and D). Involvement of calcineurin pathway induced by Ca2þ 3.3. through L-VDCCs in the DM-induced increase in Bdnf eIV-IX mRNA expression inﬂux To clarify the mechanisms responsible for the DM-induced neurotrophic activity, we investigated the effects of DM on Bdnf eIV-IX mRNA expression. We ﬁrst conﬁrmed that the pathway including VSSCs, L-VDCCs, and ERK/MAPK is responsible for the marked induction of Bdnf eIV-IX mRNA expression (data not shown), consistent with our previous report (Imamura et al., 2006). In this study, we further found that administration of 10 mM BAPTA- AM, an intracellular Ca2þ chelator, almost completely repressed the induction, whereas that of 1 mM Bay K8644, an agonist for L-VDCCs, enhanced the mRNA expression induced by DM (Fig. 3A and B). Although Bay K8644 increased the expression, the effect was quite weak compared to that of DM (Fig. 3B). In addition, the DM-induced Bdnf eIV-IX mRNA expression was markedly inhibited by 5 mM FK506, a potent inhibitor for protein phosphatase 2B, calcineurin, and partially by 20 mM U0126, an inhibitor for MEK1/2 (Fig. 3C). The simultaneous addition of 5 mM FK506 and 20 mM U0126 strength- ened the inhibition compared to that achieved by either inhibitor alone (Fig. 3C). 3.4. DM-induced Bdnf eIV-IX mRNA expression was inhibited by the activation of GABAA receptors Since addition of GABA reduced the DM-induced increase in neurite complexity and length (Fig. 2), we examined if the GABAA or GABAB receptor is effective at reducing the excitability evoked by DM. As shown in Fig. 4A, the addition of 100 mM GABA prior to the stimulation of cortical neurons with DM markedly reduced Bdnf eIV- IX mRNA expression. This reduction was also detected on the addi- tion of 10 mM muscimol, an agonist for the GABAA receptor (Fig. 4B). On the other hand, addition of 25 mM baclofen, an agonist for the GABAB receptor, did not reduce the DM-induced expression (Fig. 4C). 3.5. The DM-induced activation of Bdnf-pIV via Ca2þ elements -responsive Fig. 1. The effect of DM on MTT-reducing activity. To quantify cell viability, cultured cortical neurons were treated with DM for 12 h (A) or 24 h (B), and then the MTT assay was performed. The OD value of the unstimulated sample was regarded as 100% survival. Values represent the mean (cid:5) S.E.M (n ¼ 3e4). *p < 0.05 compared with the control using a one-way ANOVA with the TukeyeKramer test. Next, we examined whether and if so how Bdnf-pIV is activated by stimulation with DM. Three Ca2þ -responsive cis-elements (CaREs), called CaRE1, CaRE2 (or UBE), and CaRE3 (or CRE) have already been identiﬁed within Bdnf-pIV (Tao et al., 1998, 2002; Chen D. Ihara et al. / Neuropharmacology 62 (2012) 1091e Fig. 2. The effect of DM on neuronal morphology. At 4 days in culture, rat cortical neurons were transfected with a GFP plasmid for immunostaining. Two days after transfection, the neurons were pretreated with 5 mM nicardipine, 100 mM GABA (A, B, C and D) and 100 ng/mL TrkB/Fc (E, F and G) for 10 min before being 1 mM DM was administered. The neurons were ﬁxed after 6 h DM incubation. Representative images of untreated or pretreated neurons are shown (A and E). A measure of the number of neurites was obtained for each cell scored by placing a circle 20e200 mm in radius (20 mm interval) over the center of the cell and counting the number of times the circle intersects emanating from the cell body (B, C and F). Values represent the mean (cid:5) S.E.M (n ¼ 3). xp < 0.05 and xxp < 0.01 versus the control, #p < 0.05 and ##p < 0.01 compared with the DM-treated neurons, using a one-way ANOVA with the Scheffe’s F test at each length from 20 to 200 mm in radius. *p < 0.05 versus the control, yp < 0.05 compared with the DM-treated neurons, using a repeated measure ANOVA with the Bonferroni/Dunn test. Scale bar, 100 mm. The length of neurites was also measured by tracing all of the neurites starting at the cell body and extending within a 400 mm diameter (D and G).

NS, not signiﬁcant. et al., 2003). These cis-elements are responsible for the Ca2þ signal- responsive activation of Bdnf-pIV induced by membrane depolar- ization. As shown in Fig. 5A and B, Bdnf-pIV was activated by DM, the actions of which were abolished by the prior addition of 5 mM nicardipine but not with 200 mM APV, an antagonist for NMDA receptors. In addition, the DM-induced activation of Bdnf-pIV was inhibited by 10 mM BAPTA-AM but further enhanced by 1 mM Bay K8644 (Fig. S2). To examine the effect of CaREs on the DM-induced Bdnf-pIV activation, we used two kinds of Bdnf-pIV constructs. In the ﬁrst construct, CaRE1,2,3m, CaRE1, 2, and 3 are all mutated. In the second construct, CaRE3m, only CaRE3 is mutated (Fig. 5C). As shown in Fig. 5D and E, the DM-induced activation of Bdnf-pIV was reduced by the mutation of CaRE3 (or CRE), the inhibitory level of which was lower than that of CaRE1, 2 and 3. 3.6.

Fig. 4. The effect of GABAergic drugs on DM-induced Bdnf eIV-IX mRNA expression in rat cortical neurons. Ten minutes before the addition of 1 mM DM, the cells were treated with 100 mM GABA (A), 10 mM muscimol (B), or 25 mM baclofen (C), and incubated for another 3 h. The ratio of mRNA expression relative to the control is shown. Values represent the mean (cid:5) S.E.M (n ¼ 3e4). **p < 0.01 compared with the control, yyp < 0.01 versus DM with no pretreatments using a one-way ANOVA with the Scheffe’s F test. Fig. 6A(a), the [Ca2þ ]i gradually increased on average till at least 4 min after the addition of DM, though the pattern of increase varied among individual neurons (data not shown). Upon depo- larization, in contrast, the [Ca2þ ]i transiently increased just after the treatment with 25 mM KCl but rapidly decreased at 2 and 4 min (Fig. 6A(b)). The [Ca2þ ]i elevated by DM was evident even 10 min or 1 h after the incubation, while the [Ca2þ ]i elevated by depolariza- tion decreased to almost the same level as the control (Fig. 6B). We could not examine how long the [Ca2þ ]i was elevated by DM because of a limitation of measurements using fura-2. Addition of 100 mM GABA 10 min before starting the incubation reduced the [Ca2þ ]i increased by DM (Fig. 6B). Fig. 5. The role of Ca2þ signaling and CaREs in DM-induced Bdnf-pIV activation. Rat cortical neurons were co-transfected with pGL4.12-Bdnf-pIV wild type and the internal control vector phRL-TK((cid:4)), and 2 days later pretreated with 200 mM APV (A) or 5 mM nicardipine (B) for 10 min before the treatment with 1 mM DM. Cellular extracts were prepared 6 h later. **p < 0.01 compared with the control, yp < 0.05 versus the control with no pretreatments, yyp < 0.01 versus DM with no pretreatments using a one-way ANOVA with the Scheffe’s F test.

Similarly, these plasmids and phRL-TK((cid:4)) were co-transfected into neurons, and at DIV6, the cells were treated with 1 mM DM for 6 h (D and E). The ratio of Bdnf-pIV activation relative to the control is shown.

Each Ratio (F340/380) subtracted the value at time 0 and was termed “DRatio (F340/380)”. These DRatio (F340/380) values were plotted to represent the change in [Ca2þ ]i after treatment with 1 mM DM or 25 mM KCl. One mM DM or 25 mM KCl was ]i. (B) Images of [Ca2þ ]i was monitored after the period indicated. GABA (100 mM)-pretreatment was performed 10 min before the addition of DM. The cells added to neurons and, subsequently, the [Ca2þ become brighter as Ca2þ inﬂuxes into neurons. 3.7. Prolonged activation of Bdnf-pIV during the culture with DM Since the level of Bdnf eIV-IX mRNA was still increased after 24, 48 and 72 h (Imamura et al., 2006), we examined whether or not the activation of Bdnf-pIV was maintained after a prolonged DM exposure to a culture of cortical neuron. As shown in Fig. 7A, optimum activity was detected 3 and 6 h after the incubation with DM but this activation remained elevated even after 12 or 24 h though it was reduced to about one third of that at 3 or 6 h. After 5 mM nicardipine or 100 mM GABA was added 12 h after starting the incubation and the neurons were then cultured for another 6 h, the levels of Bdnf-pIV activity induced by DM were reduced (Fig. 7B). 4. Discussion Because DM markedly induces BDNF expression (Imamura et al., 2006), we expected DM to have a neurotrophic effect. As demon- strated in this study, we showed the effects of DM on the survival and structure of cultured cortical neurons. The increases in neurite complexity and length were reduced by prior addition of GABA or nicardipine, indicating that the neuronal excitability and the inﬂux of Ca2þ into neurons through L-VDCC are critical to the changes in structure of neurites. As BDNF has neurotrophic activity (Binder and Scharfman, 2004; Lipsky and Marini, 2007), it seems highly possible that endogenously synthesized BDNF, whose production could be stimulated by DM, is responsible for the neurotrophic effect of DM through the secretion of BDNF. In support of this notion, prior addition of TrkB/Fc reduced the increases in neurite complexity and length induced by DM. Next, we investigated how the neurotrophic effect of DM is controlled in neurons. By using Bay K8644 or BAPTA-AM, we conﬁrmed that extracellular and intracellular Ca2þ are essentially required for the increase in DM-induced Bdnf eIV-IX mRNA expression. The simultaneous addition of Bay K8644 with DM markedly enhanced the Bdnf eIV-IX mRNA expression, compared to the increase induced by Bay K8644 only. This effect of combined DM þ Bay K8644 is likely due to an easier accessibility of Bay K to sites within L-VDCC molecule, which could be induced by depolarization via the action of DM on VSSC. The same effect of BAPTA-AM or Bay K8644 was detected on the DM-induced acti- vation of Bdnf-pIV, indicating that the increase in Bdnf eIV-IX mRNA expression induced by DM is controlled at the transcriptional level. The selective activation of GABAA but not GABAB receptors markedly reduced the DM-induced increase in Bdnf eIV-IX mRNA expression. This result indicates that DM excites neurons through channels, whereas the activation of GABAA its action on Na receptor decreases its excitability, resulting in a reduction in the DM-induced increase in Bdnf eIV-IX mRNA expression. þ In the promoter analysis using the mutated Bdnf-pIV, we found that CRE is involved in the DM-induced activation of Bdnf-pIV. Other factors could also be involved because CaRE3m was not enough to reduce the activation. ERK/MAPK pathway induces the phosphorylation of CREB at Ser133, which can recruit the CREB- binding protein (CBP) to activate CRE-dependent transcription (Parker et al., 1996). However, it has recently become evident that TORC (transducer of regulated CREB) is dephosphorylated by cal- cineurin and then transported from the cytoplasm to the nucleus to the activate CRE-dependent transcription independently of

Since the half-life of the ﬁreﬂy luciferase protein is estimated at about 3 h (Thompson et al., 1991; Bronstein et al., 1994), it is unlikely that the increased level of Bdnf-pIV activity at 12 or 24 h is due to the luciferase synthesized immediately after the stimulation. That is, it is more likely that the Ca2þ signal-dependent activation of Bdnf-pIV continued even 24 h after the incubation. In support of this, addition of nicardipine or GABA reduced the DM-induced activation of Bdnf-pIV 12 h after the incubation of cortical neurons with DM, indicating that the Ca2þ inﬂux via L-VDCC is continuously caused by DM. Taken together, it is evident that the strong, continuous Bdnf eIV-IX mRNA expression induced by DM is primarily caused by the continuous elevation of [Ca2þ ]i and, thereby, the activation of Bdnf-pIV. Although other genes were also activated by DM (see Tables S1, S2, and S3), it seems plausible that the enhanced expression of Bdnf mRNA is mainly responsible for the neurotrophic effects of DM because the changes in cell survival and structure induced by DM in the presence or absence of inhibitors showed a good correspon- dence with those in the DM-induced Bdnf eIV-IX mRNA expression or activation of Bdnf-pIV (Fig. 8). In any case, these characteristic neurotrophin-like effects of DM may provide a novel tool to analyze the intracellular reactions widely responsible for expressing neuronal functions including cell survival, neuronal differentiation and synaptic plasticity in terms of Ca2þ homeostasis and BDNF expression in neurons. Furthermore, DM may be a possible seed for developing drugs to treat neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders.

Supporting this idea, the calcineurin pathway is involved in the control of DM-induced Bdnf eIV-IX mRNA expression, in addition to the ERK/MAPK pathway. In this study, however, it is still unclear how the calcineurin and ERK/MAPK pathways cooperate to control the DM-induced transcription of Bdnf-pIV through CREB. The addition of DM gradually increases [Ca2þ ]i, in contrast to the transient increase induced by depolarization. The most remarkable feature of the DM-induced increase was that the [Ca2þ ]i remained elevated for at least 1 h after the incubation with DM. Since the [Ca2þ ]i was high from 4 min to 1 h, it is likely that not only the inﬂux but also the efﬂux of Ca2þ from neurons is accelerated by DM. Cellular toxicity, which could be induced by an excess ﬂow of Ca2þ into neurons, was not detected, but rather, cell viability was enhanced by 1 mM DM even 24 h after the incubation. These results suggest that the turnover of intracellular Ca2þ could be accelerated in neurons stimulated with DM. Consistent with the maintenance of [Ca2þ ]i, the Bdnf-pIV activity remained elevated for at least 24 h after the incubation with 1 mM References D.
