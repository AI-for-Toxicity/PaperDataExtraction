Genotoxic Effects of Chlorpyrifos, Cypermethrin, Endosulfan and 2,4-D on Human Peripheral Lymphocytes Cultured from Smokers and Nonsmokers Suleyman Sandal*, Bayram Yilmaz Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Yeditepe University, 34755 Istanbul, Turkey Received 29 June 2009; revised 2 January 2010; accepted 11 January ABSTRACT: Pesticides often cause environmental pollution and adverse effects on human health. We have chosen four structurally different pesticides (endosulfan, an organochlorine pesticide; chlorpyrifos, an organophosphate insecticide; cypermethrin, type II pyrethroid insecticide, and 2,4-dichlorophenoxy- acetic acid, a chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbon acid pesticide) to examine and compare their effects on DNA damage in acutely cultured human lymphocytes by the comet assay. In addition, possible differen- ces in response between smoking and nonsmoking subjects were also investigated. Venous blood sam- ples were obtained from healthy male nonsmoker (n 5 7) and smoker (n 5 8) donors. Primary cultures of lymphocytes were prepared and test groups were treated with three different concentrations (1, 5, and lM) of endosulfan, chlorpyrifos, cypermehrin, and 2,4-D. DNA damage was assessed by alkaline comet assay. We determined an increase in the ratio of DNA migration in human lymphocyte cell cultures as a result of treatment with cypermethrin, 2,4-D and chlorpyrifos at high concentration. Endosulfan had no signiﬁcant genotoxic effect even at 10 lM concentration. We suggest that chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin are more potentially genotoxic than endosulfan and 2,4-D. Our ﬁndings also indicate that the only signiﬁ- cant DNA damage between smokers and nonsmokers was observed in the 2,4-D-treated group. # Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Environ Toxicol 26: 433–442, 2011.

Endosulfan, a broad-spectrum organochlorine pesticide is classiﬁed as hazardous both by World Health Organiza- tion (ATSDR, 2002; WHO, 2005) and the US Environmen- tal Protection Agency (US EPA, 2002). It is persistent in the environment and bioaccumulative in organisms because of its lipophilic features (Naqvi and Vaisnavi, 1993; Aggar- wal et al., 2008). High levels of endosulfan residues have been detected in several feed such as ﬁsh and bovine milk (Kole et al., 2001; Nag and Raikwar, 2008). Endosulfan is largely used worldwide and blamed for various health prob- lems (Venkateswarlu et al., 2000; Delen et al., 2005; Li and

SANDAL AND YILMAZ Macdonald, 2005; Karatas et al., 2006). Neurotoxicity is thought to be the essential cause of acute endosulfan toxic- ity as evidenced from endosulfan poisoning cases (Paul et al., 1995; Chugh et al., 1998). Subchronic exposure to endosulfan has been shown to cause prominent suppression of humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in rats (Banerjee and Hussain, 1986). Endosulfan-induced apopto- sis in human T-cells leukemic cell lines has also been reported (Kannan et al., 2000). Chlorpyrifos is an organophosphate (OP) insecticide and has been widely used since 1965 (US EPA, 2006a). It has been claimed that chlorpyrifos is nonteratogenic (Deacon et al., 1980), noncarcinogenic (Yano et al., 2000), and does not adversely affect reproductive functions (Breslin et al., 1996). It is well-known that OP pesticides exert their toxic effects mainly through inhibition of acetyl cholinesterase in the nervous system (Al-Saleh, 1994). Chlorpyrifos has been reported to affect chromosomes in mammalian cell cultures (Jamil et al., 2004). However, results of various studies on the genotoxic effects of chlorpyriphos appear to be contro- versial (Gollapudi et al., 1995; Akcha et al., 2008). Cypermethrin is a type II pyrethroid and more potent insecticide because of the a-cyano group in their structure (Vijverberg et al., 1982; Tabarean and Narahashi, 1998). It is widely used in agriculture, forestry, and household prod- ucts because of some favorable properties such as wide spectrum, relatively low mammalian toxicity, and rapid biodegradability (Parker et al., 1984; Vijverberg and Van den Bercken, 1990). However, widespread application of pyrethroids has caused to toxic effects in plants, animals, and human beings (US EPA, 2006b). Cypermethrin has been reported to exert carcinogenic activity in both sexes of Swiss albino mice (Shukla et al., 2002). It has been sug- gested that cypermethrin causes free radical-mediated dam- age in erythrocytes (Kale et al., 1999) and brain and liver tissues (Giray et al., 2001). The genotoxic and/or cytotoxic potential of cypermethrin has been shown in previous stud- ies (Patel et al., 2006; Suman et al., 2006). It slightly increased the number of micronucleated cells in whole blood lymphocyte cultures in human (Surralles et al., 1995). In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that cyper- methrin induces chromosomal aberrations and micronu- cleus formation in mouse bone marrow and spleen (Amer and Aboul-ela, 1985; Amer et al., 1993). The 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), a chlori- nated aromatic hydrocarbon acid pesticide, has been in extensive use since 1944, in agriculture for broad-leaved weeds, control of woody plants, and reforestation programs (IARC, 1977). It is classiﬁed as group II-B carcinogenic agent by IARC (1998). Major target organ systems of 2,4-D toxicity are the central nervous system and the cardiovascu- lar system (Osterloh et al., 1983). Despite the toxicity of 2,4-D, has been a topic of extensive research, mechanism of toxic action caused to carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, or genotoxicity is poorly understood (IARC, 1982; Nesnow Fig. 1. Chemical structures of endosulfan (A), chlorpyrifos (B), cypermethrin (C), and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (D) used in the present study. et al., 1987). It has been documented that 2,4-D is hepato- toxic: it induces lipid peroxidation and cell death in rat he- patocytes (Palmeira et al., 1995) and causes chromosomal aberrations in human lymphocytes (Korte and Jalal, 1982). In an additional study, it has been reported that 2,4-D or other phenoxy herbicides may cause non-Hodgkin’s lym- phoma through lymphocyte or immune alteration (Faustini et al., 1996). Blakley et al. (1998) suggested that alterations in lymphocyte proliferation may be a possible mechanism since lymphocytes are one of the targets of 2,4-D. On the other hand, negative ﬁndings in rat and hamster models techniques such as micronucleus (MN) using different assay, hypoxanthine-guanine-phospho-ribosyl transferase (HGPRT), and Ames test have also been reported (Charles et al., 1999a,b; Gollapudi et al., 1999). There is evidence for higher chromosomal damage in the somatic cells of smokers than in nonsmokers (IARC, 1986). The result of structural chromosome aberration test (MN), and sister chromatid (SCA), micronucleus test exchanges (SCE) have indicated that scores of SCE, SCA, and MN in lymphocytes of smokers are higher than non- smokers (Bender et al., 1988; Bonassi et al., 2003). Con- versely, some other studies have suggested that smoking has no additional effect on genetic damage (Undeger and Basaran, 2002; Sailaja et al., 2006). Various techniques (e.g., MN and SCA) have been used to identify substances with genotoxic activity. A more useful method for assessing the level of DNA damage is suggested to be the alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis, also known as comet assay (Singh et al., 1988; Saleha Banu et al., 2001). This method has previously been used to assess genotoxicity of cigarette smoke on human lymphocytes (Faust et al., 2004; Fracasso et al., 2006; de Assis et al., 2009). In the present study, four structurally different pesticides (Fig. 1), endosulfan, an organochlorine pesticide; chlorpyri- fos, an organophosphate insecticide; cypermethrin, type II pyrethroid insecticide, and 2,4-D, a chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbon acid pesticide) were selected to examine and compare their effects on DNA damage after short-term

GENOTOXIC EFFECTS OF CHLORPYRIFOS, CYPERMETHRIN, ENDOSULFAN AND 2,4-D exposure of human lymphocytes by the comet assay. In addition, possible differences in response between smoking and nonsmoking subjects were also sought. MATERIALS AND METHODS Chemicals and Reagents Lymphorep was purchased from Axis-Shield (Oslo, Nor- way). Newborn calf serum (FCS) was obtained from Bio- logical Industries (Israel). NaCl, NaOH, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and HCl were provided by Merck (Dormstadt, Germany). Pesticides, other chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Bidistilled water was used in all the experiments. Pesticides were dis- solved in DMSO (Oakes and Pollak, 2000) so that the ﬁnal concentration of DMSO was never greater than 0.1% (v/v). Subjects Fifteen healthy male nonsmoker (n 5 7) and smoker (n 8) donors between 20 and 30 years of age (mean: 27.14 2.85 and 27.57 6 2.50 years, respectively; Table I) pro- vided blood samples. Subjects had not been exposed to radiation or drugs for at least 6 months prior to the study. This study was approved by the local ethics committee on animal experimentation. Blood Sampling and Cell Preparation Whole peripheral blood samples were obtained by venous puncture. The isolation of lymphocytes was performed by centrifugation in a density gradient of lymphorep (15 min, 200 3 g) and the cells washed with RPMI-1640 medium sup- TABLE I. Patients’ characteristics plemented with 10% FCS. To determine cell viability 0.4% trypan blue was used and the cells were counted with a hemo- cytometer. After cells were prepared, test groups were treated with three different concentrations (1, 5, and 10 lM) of endo- sulfan, chlorpyrifos, cypermehrin, and 2,4-D and the vehicle control group was treated with DMSO for 1 h at 378C in a Nuaire humidiﬁed carbon dioxide incubator (Plymouth, MN). As a positive control, lymphocytes were treated with 50 lM H2O2 and incubated for 5 min on ice. After incubation, cell viability was again examined using trypan blue. Comet Assay The alkaline comet assay technique was performed as described in our previous study (Sandal et al., 2008). Brieﬂy, microscope slides were precoated with 0.75% (w/ v) high melting point agarose at PBS. The lymphocytes were mixed with 100 lL of 0.5% (w/v) low melting point agarose (LMA) at 378C and the cell suspension was pipet- ted and layered onto precoated slides. The slides were im- mediately covered with a large cover slip and kept at 48C for 5 min to allow the agarose to solidify. After the cover slips were removed, the slides were immersed in ice cold freshly prepared lysis solution (2.5 M NaCl, 100 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris, 1% sodium sarcosinate, pH 5 10) with 1% Triton X-100 and 10% DMSO for 1 h. Every dose of each compound was repeated eight times (i.e., testing on blood samples of eight different subjects). Electrophoresis After lysis, the slides were placed in a horizontal gel elec- trophoresis tank (Bio-Rad, USA) positioned close to the an- ode and covered with fresh alkaline electrophoresis buffer Subjects Gender Age (years) Profession Smoking (py) Alcohol (g/day)a

Electrophoresis was conducted at V (0.83 V/cm) and 300 mA for 20 min. After electrophore- sis, the slides were washed three times with neutralizing buffer (0.4 M Tris, pH 5 7.5) at 48C for 5 min each. Then the slides were dried and stained with 20 lg mL21 ethidium bromide and covered with a cover slip. The slides were incubated at 48C in a refrigerator for 20 min before scoring. All of the steps were conducted in the dark to prevent addi- tional DNA damage. Slide Scoring Fifty cells per slide and two slides per sample were scored to evaluate DNA damage for each pesticide concentrations. The slides were examined under a ﬂuorescent microscope (Zeiss, Germany) equipped with suitable ﬁlters at magniﬁcation. The slides were blinded to the scorer. The cells were classiﬁed by eye in to four categories on the ba- sis of the extent of DNA migration, undamaged (UD), low damage (LD), moderate damage (MD), and high damage (HD, Fig. 2). Total comet scores (TCSs) were calculated on 100 randomly selected cells as: 1 3 UD 1 2 3 LD 1 3 MD 1 4 3 HD. Statistical Analysis All results are expressed as mean 6 SD. The data were stat- istically analyzed by using One-Way ANOVA, followed by the Tukey HSD test. SPSS 15.0 for Windows was utilized for analysis. Statistical signiﬁcance was considered at P \ 0.05. RESULTS The cell viability was above 90% in all groups both before and after incubation with pesticides (data not presented). All results are presented in Table II (nonsmokers) and Table III (smokers). The DMSO control values did not sig- niﬁcantly differ between the smokers and nonsmokers. The positive control (H2O2) shows a striking increase in DNA damage, especially in the high damage category (P \ 0.001). Figure 3(A) shows the effects of cypermethrin in non- smoking donors, whereas Figure 3(B) illustrates results from smoking persons, assessed at 1 h after treatment. Cypermethrin at a concentration of 10 lM caused signiﬁ- cant increases in DNA damage in both smoking and non- smoking groups compare to control and DMSO (P \ 0.05). The lower concentration of cypermethrin (1 and 5 lM) had no signiﬁcant effects in both groups. The effects of chlorpyrifos on DNA migration in lym- phocyte cell cultures of nonsmoking donors are presented in Figure 4(A) while Figure 4(B) shows result of smoking donors. Chlorpyrifos at 1 and 5 lM did not signiﬁcantly alter DNA damage in lymphocytes of nonsmoking and

All concentrations of 2,4-D (1, 5, and 10 lM) had no signiﬁcant effects on lymphocytes of nonsmoking donors. No signiﬁcant alteration of DNA fragmentation was seen in human lymphocytes treated with endosulfan at 1, 5, and 10 lM concentrations. TABLE III. Comet assay scores in smokers (mean 6 SD) DISCUSSION In the present study, genotoxic properties of four different group of pesticides have been comparatively tested for the ﬁrst time by using comet assay. We have determined an increase in the ratio of DNA migration in human lympho- cyte cell cultures as a result of treatment with cypermethrin, 2,4-D, and chlorpyrifos. The lower doses (1 and 5 lM) of all pesticides tested did not cause any signiﬁcant change in both smokers and nonsmokers. Endosulfan had no signiﬁ- cant genotoxic effect even at 10 lM concentration.

SANDAL AND YILMAZ apart from that in the hematopoietic system. It has been reported that cypermethrin induced a clear signiﬁcant posi- tive dose-dependent increase in DNA damage in the rat liver cells (El-Khatib et al., 2006). Undeger and Basaran (2002) observed DNA damage in lymphocytes of workers occupationally exposed to cypermethrin. Later, the same group conﬁrmed that cypermethrin and permethrin signiﬁ- cantly increased DNA damage in human lymphocytes (Undeger and Basaran, 2005). Cypermethrin induced DNA damage in Chinese hamster ovary cells a dose-dependent manner (Patel et al. 2007) and increased frequency of sister chromatic exchange in mouse bone marrow cells (Giri et al., 2003). Our ﬁndings show that cypermethrin causes Fig. 3.

Results of several studies on the genotoxicity of endosul- fan have demonstrated inconsistent results (Chaudhuri et al., 1999; Falck et al., 1999). Das et al. (2007) reported that 0.5–4.0 lM concentrations of endosulfan caused signif- icant DNA damage as indicated by visible tail lengths. In the present study, we have shown that endosulfan had no signiﬁcant effect on DNA damage in lymphocyte cell cul- tures obtained from smoker and nonsmoker subjects. Dis- crepancy between our ﬁndings and those reported by others (Akay et al., 1999; Jamil et al., 2004) may be attributed to selected cell types and concentrations of endosulfan. Patel et al. (2006) have demonstrated that cypermethrin induces systemic genotoxicity in mammals as it causes DNA damage in vital organs like brain, liver, and kidney, Fig. 4.

GENOTOXIC EFFECTS OF CHLORPYRIFOS, CYPERMETHRIN, ENDOSULFAN AND 2,4-D tal risk (IARC, 1991). Mustonen et al. (1986) have reported no signiﬁcant change in the number of aberrations in human lymphocyte cultures treated with pure 2,4-D, whereas the commercial 2,4-D formulation (in different concentration), signiﬁcantly increased the number of chromosomal aberra- tions in vitro. While some workers (Andersen et al., 1972; Zetterberg et al., 1977) did not observe any mutagenic ac- tivity of 2,4-D, others have suggested a relationship between 2,4-D and development of soft tissue sarcoma as well as malignant lymphomas (Bond et al., 1989). Immuno- suppressive effects have been reported in rats treated with subtoxic doses of this herbicide (Imel’baeva et al., 2000). Application of a commercial 2,4-D in cultured human lym- phocytes caused an increase in rate of SCE (Turkula and Jalal, 1985). In the present study, the highest concentration of 2,4-D (10 lM) signiﬁcantly increased DNA damage in smokers’ lymphocyte cell cultures while it did not cause any signiﬁcant change in those collected from nonsmokers. This appears to be an important observation, however, lack of relevant literature makes it difﬁcult to compare and dis- cuss. Mechanism of 2,4-D induced genotoxicity and its cor- relation with smoking habit should be further investigated. Cigarette smoke contains a large number of substances that are hazardous to human health. Smoking habits cause DNA damage in human lymphotyctes (de Assis et al., 2009). Impact of smoking habit on mutagenic effects of pesticide exposure has long been questioned. In a study conducted on cotton ﬁeld workers who were exposed to several persistent pesticides; total frequency of chromo- somal aberrations in smokers was more than those deter- mined in the unexposed population (n 5 20) (Rupa et al., 1989). It was reported that these subjects were exposed to dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane, benzene hexa chloride, endosulfan, malathion, methyl parathion, monocrotophos, quinolphos, dimethoate, phosphomidon, cypermethrin, and fenvelrate in the cotton ﬁelds. However, others have sug- gested that smoking has no additional effect on genetic damage (Undeger and Basaran, 2002; Sailaja et al., 2006). In our study, we did not determine additional genotoxic effects of the pesticides tested (except 2,4-D) on human lymphocytes collected from smoking subjects. This dis- crepancy may be attributed to long exposure period of some of these pesticides in smoker workers (Rupa et al., 1989) compared to very short incubation period in vitro in our study. Exposure to a mixture of chemicals in the afore- mentioned study may also be another factor increasing the chromosomal aberrations in smokers. In conclusion, results of the present study suggest that OP (chlorpyrifos) and type II pyrethroid (cypermethrin) compounds are more potentially genotoxic than organo- chlorinated (endosulfan) and chlorinated aromatic hydro- carbon acid (2,4-D) pesticides at the same concentration. These effects of cypermethrin and chlorpyrifos were observed at the highest concentrations tested. Our ﬁndings also suggest that smoking habit of the subject from whom Fig. 5.

We have also determined that there was no signiﬁcant differ- ence in terms of cypermethrin-induced DNA damage between smokers and nonsmokers. elicits corresponding, long-term deﬁcits Recent studies have demonstrated that OP pesticides at sublethal acute doses both affect several biochemical path- ways and exert genotoxic effects (Al-Saleh, 1994; Masoud et al., 2003). Navarro et al. (2001) reported that exposure to chlorpyrifos during developmental period at which this OP pesticide is known to produce lasting changes in neural function, in immune system. The use of this insecticide continues to increase both in domestic and agricultural application, a reﬂection of the safety of this agent relative to the other related compounds (Roy et al., 1998). Gurunathan et al. (1998) indicated that spraying of chloropyriphos in the indoor environment may pose considerable risk to public health. Genotoxicity was also observed for chlorpyriphos- ethyl in phytoplanktons (Akcha et al., 2008). Das et al. (2006) have revealed that OP pesticides such as chlorpyri- fos induced apoptosis and necrosis in cultured human pe- ripheral blood lymphocytes in in vitro conditions at low cytotoxic doses. The present study has shown that chloro- pyriphos produce genotoxic effects on human lymphocyte cells at the highest concentration (10 lM) used. Smoking habit did not seem to signiﬁcantly affect direction and in- tensity of the genotoxicity. Despite its decades of usage, there is relatively little data regarding 2,4-D’s effects on human health and environmen- SANDAL AND YILMAZ primary lymphocyte cultures were prepared does not inﬂu- ence the direction and level of DNA damage in terms of ex- posure to cypermethrin and chlorpyrifos.
