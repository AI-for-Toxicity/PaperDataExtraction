Voltage-gated calcium channel

## 1. Introduction

Plant parasitic nematodes (PPN) are one of the most damaging pests of cultivated crop causing an estimated loss of at least $100 billion per annum [1,2]. Currently, the most successful approaches for controlling PPN are extensive use of chemical nematicides, including fumigant nematicide methyl bromide, carbamate- and organophosphate-based nematicides. However, these nematicides have now been banned or highly restricted due to their environmental and human health risks. There is an urgent need to identify potential target sites in nematodes that can be exploited for their control.

Pyrethroids are widely used pesticides and divided into two types according to the presence or absence of cyano group. Type-II pyrethroid has a cyano group at the α -position, while type-I does not. The primary targets for the action of pyrethroids are VGSCs [3,4]. Pyrethroids reduce the dynamic process of both the activation and inactivation of VGSCs,

## a b s t r a c t

Deltamethrin belongs to the class of synthetic pyrethroids, which are being widely used as insecticides in agricultural practices. Voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) are the primary targets of these chemicals for toxicity to insects. Caenorhabditis elegans ( C. elegans ) does not have VGSCs but is susceptible to deltamethrin. Recent /uniFB01 ndings have suggested that pyrethroids can affect voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). However, it remains elusive whether deltamethrin induces toxicity to C. elegans via modulating the activity of VGCCs. To identify the potential target of deltamethrin, we exposed C. elegans to different concentrations of deltamethrin and Ca 2+ channel blockers for different times, characterized the behavioral toxicity of deltamethrin on C. elegans , and determined the expression of egl -19, unc -2, and cca -1, which encode the α 1-subunit of the L-, R/N/P/Q-, and T-type VGCC, respectively. We found that deltamethrin inhibited the locomotion, egg-laying and foraging ability of C. elegans in a concentration dependentmanner.Wealsoshowedthatbodylengthofwormsonagarplatescontaining200mgL -1 deltamethrin for 12 h was not signi /uniFB01 cantly different from controls, whereas the cholinesterase inhibitor carbofuran caused hypercontraction which is a characteristic of organophosphates and carbamates, suggesting that deltamethrin's mode of action is distinct from those nematicides. In addition, unc -2 was signi /uniFB01 cantly up-regulated following 0.05 mg L -1 deltamethrin exposure for 24 h; while egl -19 and cca -1 were signi /uniFB01 cantly up-regulated following 5 and 50 mg L -1 deltamethrin exposure for 24 h. Further tests of worms' sensitivity and expression of three α 1-subunits of VGCC to Ca 2+ channel blockers indicate that deltamethrin may induce toxic behavior C. elegans via modulation of the expression of the α 1-subunits of VGCC. This study provides insights into the linkage between deltamethrin-induced toxic behavior and the regulation of α 1-subunits of VGCC in C. elegans .

resulting in a prolonged depolarizing tail current that can lead to increased excitability [5,6]. Meanwhile, the difference of the length of delayed time for both the activation and inactivation of VGSC attributes to the different symptoms to type I and II pyrethroids [6]. Other targets, particularly VGCCs and chloride channels, have been implicated as alternative or secondary sites of action for a subset of pyrethroids [7,8]. Several studies have shown that pyrethroids affect VGCCs at the same concentration range as for VGSCs [8 -12]. It has been reported that type II pyrethroid promotes the release of the synapse neurotransmitter via targeting VGCCs [13]. In addition, recent studies have demonstrated that pyrethroids including allethrin and deltamethrin inhibit T-, L-, P/Qand N-type voltage-activated Ca 2+ channels in oocytes [11,14]. Therefore, inhibition of calcium dynamics and VGCC activity plays an important role in the toxicity of pyrethroids.

Caenorhabditis elegans ( C. elegans ) as a popular model organism has conserved physiology and pharmacology with parasitic nematodes and has been exploited to provide insight into the mode of action of anthelmintic or nematicide [15 -19]. The C. elegans genomecontains /uniFB01 ve genes encoding putative VGCC α 1 subunit egl -19, cca -1, unc -2, nca -1 and nca -

2[20]. Sequence analysis has shown that egl -19, unc -2, and cca -1 are homologues to the vertebrate α 1 subunits conducting L-type, P/Q/R/Ntype, and T-type VGCC, respectively [21 -23]. The unc -2 is primarily expressed in motor neurons, several subsets of sensory neurons, and the HSN and VC neurons controlling egg-laying [24]. In situ characterization of voltage-gated calcium currents has shown that the α 1 subunit cca -1 underlies a T-type current in pharyngeal muscle whereas egl -19 carries L-type currents both in pharyngeal and body muscles [23 -26].

Several studies of neurotoxic pyrethroids utilizing C. elegans have found pyrethroids including cypermethrin and cyhalothrin elicit toxicity by affecting physiological parameters viz., egg laying, brood size, feeding rate and life span at sublethal concentrations [27 -30]; However, the underlying mechanism remains to be determined. VGSC is the wellknowntarget of pyrethroids, but has not yet been detected in C. elegans . We speculate that pyrethroids may exert their toxicity via targeting VGCC in C. elegans .

In this study, in order to de /uniFB01 ne the role of VGCC in pyrethroid-induced behavior changes in C. elegans , we examined the behavioral toxicity of a well-studied type II pyrethroid deltamethrin on C. elegans , and assessed the expression of egl -19, unc -2, and cca -1, encoding for the α 1subunit of the L-, R/N/P/Q-, and T-type VGCC, respectively, under different dosages of chronic deltamethrin exposure.

## 2. Materials and methods

## 2.1. Reagents, C. elegans culture and drug treatment

Wild type C. elegans strain (N2) was used in this study and cultured at 20 °C on nematode growth medium (NGM) plates seeded with Escherichia coli strain OP50 as source of food according to a standard protocol [31]. Age synchronous populations of L4-larvae stage were obtained by collecting populations of eggs and allowing them to develop as described by Donkin and Williams [32]. Deltamethrin (technical grade, 95% purity) and carbofuran (technical grade, 97% purity) were provided by Jiangsu Yangnong Chemicals Ltd. (Yangzhou, China) and Hunan Research Institute of Chemical Industry (Changsha, China), respectively. Voltage-gated calcium channel blockers verapamil, diltiazem, nifedipine and mibefradil were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

Chemicals were /uniFB01 rst dissolved to a concentration of 1% ( w / v ) in acetone with tween-80 as emulsi /uniFB01 er. Chemical emulsi /uniFB01 able concentrates were further diluted with K-medium (0.032 M KCl and 0.051 M NaCl) to different concentrations of stock solution. The stock solution was added to autoclaved NGM to /uniFB01 nal concentrations. The same volume of acetone as chemical stock solution was added as a vehicle control. Worms from synchronized culture (2 days after hatching) were incubated on NGM plate with different concentrations of chemical for 24 h, followed by analyses of mortality, behavioral toxicity and gene expression. Behavioral assays in liquid were conducted in M9 buffer (KH2PO4 3 g, Na2HPO4 6 g, NaCl 5 g, 1 M MgSO4 1 mL, in 1 L distilled water).

## 2.2. Lethal toxicity test

About one hundred L4 stage worms were transferred onto each NGM plates containing different concentrations of deltamethrin, carbofuran or vehicle control, and cultured for 24 h at 20 °C. Each compound was tested with /uniFB01 ve concentrations in four replicates. The tested concentrations of deltamethrin and carbofuran were between 5 and 200 mg L -1 based on the previous experiment results. The numbers of live and dead worms were then counted under a dissecting microscope by probing the worms with a platinum wire.

## 2.3. C. elegans behavioral toxicity analysis

Following the 24 h incubation with exposure to sublethal concentrations of deltamethrin and carbofuran, worms were removed and washed 3 times in M9 buffer, and then the thrashing rate, body bend frequency, egg laying rates and foraging behavior were evaluated.

To assay the head thrashes, washed worms was transferred into a microtiter well containing 60 μ L of M9 buffer on the top of agar. Thrashes produced by each worm in a 1 min period were counted after a 2 min equilibration period. A thrash was de /uniFB01 ned as a change in direction of bending at the mid body as previously described [33]. To assay the body bends, worms were picked onto a second plate. The number of body bend generated in a 20 s time interval was counted. A body bend was de /uniFB01 ned as a change in the direction of propagation of the part of the worm corresponding to the posterior bulb of the pharynx along the y -axis, assuming the worm was traveling along the x-axis. 30 worms were examined per treatment, and three independent experiments were performed.

To assay the egg laying rates, worms were individually transferred to OP50/NGM plates that contained either vehicle or varying concentrations of deltamethrin. After 3 h, the adult worms were removed and discarded, and the number of laid eggs was counted. 10 worms were examined per treatment, and three independent experiments were performed.

The detection of foraging behavior was performed according to the method of Kohra [34]. In brief, E. coli was grown circularly within a 0.5 cm radius from the center of a chemical-free 9 cm NGM plate, and the washed worms those exposed to sublethal concentrations of deltamethrin for 24 h were transferred to plates for the foraging behavior assay. The worms were evenly placed 4 cm from the center. Each test was performed with plate loaded with 12 worms in /uniFB01 ve replicates. After 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 h of incubation at 20 °C, the numbers of nematode that have reached the E. coli colony were counted in each plate. The attainment level of C. elegans was obtained by dividing the number of worm that reached the food source by the total number of worms on the plate.

## 2.4. Effect of deltamethrin on worm length

Assays were conducted as previously described [35]. The experimental L4 stage worms were imaged on a clean unseeded NGM plate before the treatment. Then, 10 worms were transferred to NGM plate containing 200 mg L -1 drugs. Further images were taken over 12 h. Software GSA Image Analyser that provides a skeleton image of the worm was used to measure its length. The lengths of individual worms on the drug (or control) plates were compared with the length of the same worm prior to treatment to give a fraction of the initial length of the worm. Measurements were normalized to the initial length for each individual worm.

## 2.5. RT-PCR analysis of VGCC gene expression in C. elegans

Total RNA from C. elegans was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA was quanti /uniFB01 ed by a Nanodrop ND-1000 (Nanodrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA). First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μ g of each RNA sample in a 20 μ L reaction volume with Oligo dT-Adaptor Primer using the RNA PCR Kit (AMV) Ver. 3.0 (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). Real-time PCR was conducted using SYBR® Premix Ex Taq ™ II (Perfect Real Time) (TaKaRa) in a typical 20 μ L PCR mixture that included 10 μ L of SYBR® Premix Ex Taq ™ II, 2 μ L of template cDNA, and 0.4 μ Mof each PCR primer. Cycling conditions were 95 °C for 30 s, 40 cycles at 95 °C for 3 s, 58 °C for 30 s, followed by dissociation curve analysis at 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C 1 min and 95 °C for 15 s to verify the ampli /uniFB01 cation of a single product. PCR reactions were run on an Applied Biosystems 7300 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The results were analyzed using the ΔΔ Ct method [36]. Actin mRNA was used for expression-level normalization of the studied genes. Primers were designed using the Primer express 3.0 software and are listed in Table 1.

## 2.6. Data analysis

Median lethal concentration (LC50) was derived through Probits analysis. Statistical analysis was conducted using DPS v12.01 software for Windows 7. The data are presented as mean ± standard error of mean (SEM). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for comparison between the control and treatment groups in thrashing rates, body bendfrequency, egg-laying rates, attainment levels and gene expression levels. If there was a signi /uniFB01 cant difference among treatment groups at 0.05 and 0.01 signi /uniFB01 cant levels, least signi /uniFB01 cant difference (LSD) of multiple comparisons was conducted to compare the mean of each group.

## 3. Results

## 3.1. C. elegans are sensitive to deltamethrin

To test the toxicity of deltamethrin to C. elegans , 100 of L4 stage worms were exposed to NGM plates containing different concentrations of deltamethrin (12.5 -400 mg L -1 ) or vehicle control for 24 h. The numbers of live and dead worms were counted under a dissecting microscope. After 24 h, deltamethrin showed a signi /uniFB01 cant effect on the survival of C. elegans in a concentration dependent manner . At concentration of 400 mg L -1 deltamethrin, the entire population worms were dead. Acute toxicity was studied using LC50 derived through Probit analysis (Table 2). The half lethal concentration of deltamethrin to C. elegans was 55.8 mg L -1 . While, under the same conditions, the LC50 of carbofuran to C. elegans was 29.8 mg L -1 .

## 3.2. Deltamethrin decreases the thrashing and body bend frequency of C. elegans

To assess C. elegans behavioral toxicity following exposure to deltamethrin, worms were treated with sub-lethal concentrations of deltamethrin for 24 h. The thrashes of each worm in a 1 min period were counted after a 2 min equilibration period. As shown in Fig. 1, deltamethrin exposure at concentrations 0.5 mg L -1 signi /uniFB01 cantly decreased the thrashing of L4 C. elegans larvae. And the head thrashing frequency was 64.3 ± 1.2 times per min. Furthermore, exposure at 5 mg L -1 carbofuran, the head thrashing frequency was 52.3 ± 2.8 times per min.

The body bend is the change in the direction of propagation of the part of the worm corresponding to the posterior bulb of the pharynx and an important index of behavioral toxicity of worm. Deltamethrin at concentrations N 0.5 mg L -1 signi /uniFB01 cantly reduced the body bend frequencyof L4 C. elegans larvae (Fig. 2). And the body bend frequency was 21.4 ± 0.4 times per 20 s. While, the body bend frequency was 12.6 ± 0.8 times per 20 s at 5 mg L -1 carbofuran. These results demonstrated that deltamethrin exposure led to decreased thrashing and body bend frequency of L4 C. elegans larvae in a concentration-dependent manner.

## 3.3. Deltamethrin reduces the egg-laying of C. elegans

To check deltamethrin on the ability of egg-laying of C. elegans , L4 stage worms were individually transferred to OP50/NGM plates (10 worms per plate) that contained either vehicle or varying concentrations of deltamethrin. After 3 h, the number of laid eggs was counted. As shown in Fig. 3, exposure to 5 mg L -1 deltamethrin for 24 h caused a signi /uniFB01 cant reduction in the egg laying when compared to the control. The number of eggs laid per 10 worms in control group was 25.0 ± 1.1, while that in worms exposed to 5 mg L -1 deltamethrin was 19.8 ± 1.2.

## 3.4. Effect of deltamethrin on foraging behavior in C. elegans

To assess the foraging behavior of worms following deltamethrin exposure, worms were transferred to chemical-free 9 cm NGM plates containing E. coli grown circularly within a 0.5 cm radius from the center. After 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 h of incubation at 20 °C, the numbers of nematode that have reached the E. coli colony were counted in each plate. As showninFig. 4, the attainment levels decreased signi /uniFB01 cantly after deltamethrin exposure at 5 mg L -1 for 2 h and 24 h compared to the control. However, there were no signi /uniFB01 cant differences between treatments and controls at 4, 6, and 8 h. Comparatively, C. elegans have a lower attainment level at 5 mg L -1 carbofuran.

## 3.5. Effect of deltamethrin on VGCC gene expression in C. elegans

To explore the underlying mechanism of deltamethrin on C. elegans behavioral toxicity, we treated worms with different concentrations of deltamethrin for 24 h and determined the mRNA levels egl19, cca1 and unc2 by RT-PCR. Compared with control, the mRNA levels of egl -19 were up-regulated signi /uniFB01 cantly by 6.3 fold in nematodes exposed to 5 mg L -1 , and down-regulated signi /uniFB01 cantly by 9.7 fold at 0.5 mg L -1 ; the mRNA levels of cca -1 genes were increased signi /uniFB01 cantly by 13.6 fold at the concentration of 50 mg L -1 , and decreased at 0.5 and 0.05 mg L -1 ; the expression levels of unc -2 gene were up-regulated signi /uniFB01 cantly by 8.3 fold at concentration of 0.05 mg L -1 , and down-regulated signi /uniFB01 cantly by 5.7 fold at 0.5 mg L -1 (Fig. 5). These results demonstrated that the expression of the subunits of VGCC was differentially altered by different concentrations of deltamethrin in C. elegans .

## 3.6. Comparison of the effects of deltamethrin and the carbamate carbofuran

Both deltamethrin and carbofuran inhibit C. elegans motility, egg laying and foraging (Figs.1, 2 and 3). To further support these observations, measurements were made from images captured of L4 larvae before and after exposure to either 200 mg L -1 carbofuran or deltamethrin for 12 h. We found that carbofuran elicited shortening in contrast to deltamethrin, which there was no overall change in the body length. The results indicate that its mode of paralysis is distinct from that of carbofuran as hyper-contraction was not observed (Fig. 6).

## 3.7. The sensitivity of C. elegans to VGCC blockers

To assess the toxicity of VGCC blockers to C. elegans , we exposed wormsto 500, 50 and 5 mg L -1 VGCC blockers for 24 h and then counted the mortality rate of the worms. Table 3 showed the mortality rate of worms treated with mibefradil was the same as that treated with deltamethrin, and higher than those treated with verapamil, diltiazem and nifedipine at 5, 50 and 500 mg L -1 . In addition, after 24 h exposure, worms were washed with ddH2O and transferred to plates, and the morphology of dead worms was observed. The characteristic shape of worms killed by deltamethrin was straight (Fig.7B) or bent (Fig.7C), and very few showed a wavy shape, which was similar to those killed by VGCC blockers nifedipine, verapamil and mibefradil. These similarities suggest that the occurrence of the straight shape was related and might represent a similar in toxicity.

## 3.8. Effect of Ca 2+ channel blockers on VGCC gene expression in C. elegans

Since the direct target of Ca 2+ channel blockers are the VGCC, we tested the expressions of three α 1-subunits of VGCC genes under sublethal concentrations of Ca 2+ channel blockers (500 mg L -1 for verapamil, diltiazem and nifedipine, 50 mg L -1 for mibefradil). Fig. 8 showed the fold change in gene expression of three α 1-subunits of VGCC gene. Of these genes, egl -19 was signi /uniFB01 cantly down-regulated at 500 mg L -1 verapamil (L-type Ca 2+ channel blockers) and 50 mg L -1 mibefradil (T-type Ca 2+ channel blockers) treatment; unc2 was down-regulated at 500 mg L -1 verapamil or diltiazem, and 50 mg L -1 mibefradil treatment. Interestingly, there was no signi /uniFB01 cant difference of cca -1 expression at T-type Ca 2+ channel blockers treatment, but wasup-regulated by 2.1 and 3.2 fold at 500 mg L -1 diltiazem and nifedipine. However, cca -1 was signi /uniFB01 cantly up-regulated at 50 mg L -1 deltamethrin treatment (Fig. 5).

Following the 24 h incubation with NGM plates containing sublethal concentrations of drugs for 24 h, L4 worms were removed and washed 3 times in M9 buffer, and then transferred to chemical-free 9 cm NGM plates containing E. coli grown circularly within a 0.5 cm radius from the center. After 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 h of incubation at 20 °C, the numbers of nematode that have reached the E. coli colony were counted in each plate.

attainment levels in C. elegans. Furthermore, deltamethrin exposure resulted in differential expression of the subunits of VGCC in C. elegans. These results suggest that deltamethrin may induce toxic behavior on C. elegans via regulating the expression of the α 1-subunits of VGCC.

Elucidation of the toxic effect of neurotoxic pesticides on the behavior change of C. elegans may advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the toxicity that is induced by these chemicals. Neurotoxic insecticides usually cause locomotion, egg laying and foraging behavior defects in C. elegans when its sensory neurons and nerve conduction are impaired, and cuticule, vulval and pharyngeal muscles are inhibited. C. elegans moves in a sinusoidal fashion by generating waves of alternating dorsal and ventral muscle contraction [37]. Egglaying are controlled by two types of neurons and two sets of muscles [38]. We demonstrated in this study that, both type-II pyrethroid insecticide deltamethrin and carbofuran altered the behaviors in C. elegans , including thrashing, body bend frequency, egg laying and foraging behavior. Taken together these observations suggest that deltamethrin and carbofuran might have a similar mechanism of action. However, the deltamethrin treated worms showed no hyper-contraction. Carbofuran is an anticholinesterase. In the presence of carbofuran, acetylcholine accumulates in the synaptic cleft as a result of the inability of acetylcholinesterase to break down acetylcholine. This build-up of acetylcholine leads to over-activation of cholinergic receptors, muscle hyper-contraction, paralysis, and eventually cell death [16,39]. Thus, deltamethrin and carbofuran showed the difference on body length, indicating the pro /uniFB01 le of actions of deltamethrin in C. elegans is distinct from carbofuran.

While some studies have shown that the above behaviors are controlled by multiple factors. For example, the hermaphrodite-speci /uniFB01 c neurons (HSNs) control 16 egg-laying muscles via electrical connection between the vulval and the uterine muscles, although the HSNs make synapses directly only onto the vulval muscles [40,41]. Foraging is a rapid, side-to-side movement of the nose generated by C. elegans as it explores its environment. Several neurons, including odorant-sensing AWA and AWC neurons, the OLQ and IL1 sensory neurons and the RMGmotor neurons, have been shown to be required for this behavior [42,43]. Pharyngeal neurons MC, M2, M4, and I1 form multiple direct and indirect excitatory pathways in a robust network for control of pharyngeal pumping [44]. Therefore, whether deltamethrin is toxic to these neurons needs further investigation.

In addition, the expression levels of 3 genes encoding the α 1-subunits of VGCC were changed in C. elegans after 24 h exposure of L4 worms to different concentrations of deltamethrin. The results suggest that modulations of VGCC were not speci /uniFB01 c to individual subunits of VGCC: cca -1, which is expressed in pharyngeal muscle, was speci /uniFB01 cally up-regulated in the 50 mg L -1 treatment. Likewise, egl19, which is expressed in pharyngeal and body muscles, was signi /uniFB01 cantly up-regulated at 5 mg L -1 deltamethrin, and unc -2, which is required in the

HSNs and/or VCs to negatively regulate egg-laying, was signi /uniFB01 cantly up-regulated at 0.05 mg L -1 . The results suggest that egl -19, cca -1, and unc -2 may be potential regulators of deltamethrin-dependent behaviors at different concentration of deltamethrin. Interestingly, all the three α 1-subunits of VGCC were down-regulated in C. elegans following 0.5 mg L -1 deltamethrin exposure. It remains to be determined whether low level and chronic exposure of deltamethrin is associated to desensitization of VGCC receptors.

Tofurther identify which VGCCs are involved, we selected 4 different VGCCblockers (three were L-type, one was T-type) and tested their relative nematicidal activity and effects on three α 1-subunits of VGCC expression in C. elegans . Among 4 VGCC blockers, mibefradil (T-type) demonstrated the highest lethal activity, followed by nifedipine (Ltype). Further analysis of the expression of α 1-subunits of VGCC following Ca 2+ channel blockers treatment revealed that egl -19 was signi /uniFB01 -cantly down-regulated at both deltamethrin and four Ca 2+ channel blockers.

In summary, we revealed that deltamethrin was toxic to and reduced the locomotion, egg laying and foraging behavior of C. elegans by modulating the expression of α 1-subunits of VGCC, egl -19, cca -1, and unc -2. Our /uniFB01 ndings may provide insights into the linkage between deltamethrin-induced toxic behavior and the regulation of α 1-subunit of VGCC.
